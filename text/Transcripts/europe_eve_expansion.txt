Imagine a world, right, for nearly a thousand years, where your place in society was just absolutely fixed, where your salvation, your eternal soul was controlled by this tiny elite group, and where pretty much every aspect of life was tangled up with this one single dominant religious institution. It's hard to even wrap your head around that kind of stability, that kind of certainty, even if it was rigid. Exactly. But then almost overnight, it feels like, in historical terms, that whole massive structure starts to crack, it starts to crumble, and then it just shatters, you know, and it unleashes these forces that would totally reshape continents, reshape how people saw themselves, and basically define the modern world for centuries afterwards. It's just a moment of incredible transformation, a real turning point. Totally. Okay, so let's unpack this. We're diving into a really, really pivotal period. Europe on the eve of expansion. The sources we're digging into today, they paint this incredibly vivid picture of the dramatic shift from what we usually call the Middle Ages into the modern period. And they reveal these profound changes in society, in religion, in power dynamics, all the stuff that shaped the continent as we know it and really set the stage for Europe's, well, dramatic global reach later on. Yeah, the groundwork was being laid, even if people didn't realize it at the time. When I say sources, we've got some really rich material to work with here. We're looking at partly a conceptual map, which is great because it lays out the key themes, the timelines. It gives us that essential bird's eye view. The scaffolding, the big picture framework. Exactly. But then we also have this deep dive lecture transcript that really fills in the incredible details, the human stories behind it, all the surprising facts behind these huge continent shaping shifts, which is where it really comes alive. I think it's like getting the blueprint and the immersive tour all at once so we can see not just what happened, but start to connect the dots on the interconnected why. And that's what's truly fascinating here, I think, how these sources let us connect things that seem totally separate at first glance. You know, the fall of ancient empires way back when, these really complex theological debates happening in universities and monasteries, the nitty gritty of how medieval society was actually structured. Even things like architectural choices like the buildings themselves telling a story. Precisely. They help us understand why Europe, which, let's be honest, was kind of a relative backwater for a good chunk of this time. Yeah. Compared to, say, China or the Islamic world. Right. Why it was nevertheless poised for such dramatic global expansion. Not just that it happened, but the underlying reasons. So our mission really is to pull out those crucial nuggets of insight, the key connections that illuminate this really complex transformation, and show you how it all still resonates, often in unexpected ways in our world today, shaping our institutions, our identities, even, you know, our modern conflict. So think of this deep dive as your ultimate shortcut, maybe, to understanding this foundational period. It's perfect if you want to get context quickly, but also thoroughly, and hopefully it'll be packed with those surprising facts and those really satisfying aha. Moments that make history click. Yeah, those connections across time. Exactly. Making you feel well informed on a period that literally changed the trajectory of the world. So if you're ready to peel back the layers of centuries and see the surprising origins of our modern world, let's jump right in. Okay. So before we dive deep into the Middle Ages itself, it's probably crucial to understand how history itself gets framed. Right? Especially this Western timeline our sources use. Can you walk us through those main eras, Classical, medieval, modern, and maybe touch on why we have to specify Western history here? Absolutely. It's fundamental to how we even talk about this stuff. So from a European or American perspective, history, Western history is typically sliced into three big chunks. First, you've got the classical era. That's the Greeks and the Romans. Think Parthenon, think Caesar, roughly, let's say 800 BCE up to about 500 CE. Okay. The foundations. Right. Then starting around 476 CE is the usual marker we enter the medieval period. Now, this one gets called a lot of things. The Middle Ages, obviously, because it's between classical and modern. So sometimes the Christian era, for reasons we'll definitely get into, and sometimes, though, it's a bit loaded. The Dark Ages. Right. We hear that one a lot. We do. And this period is long. We're talking almost a thousand years running roughly until 1453 CE, another key date. After that, we transition into the modern era, which takes us pretty much up to the mid 20th century. And then finally, we land in what historians now often call the postmodern era, which is basically, you know, now. Ish. So classical, medieval, modern, postmodern. Got it. But why the emphasis on Western? That is absolutely crucial. This timeline, classical, medieval, modern, it's a Western centric view. It's a construct really developed by European historians looking back, trying to make sense of their past, their heritage, other massive, complex civilizations. Think about China with its dynasties or various African empires, or South Asian history. They categorize their past very differently. Their Timelines are based on their own unique developments, their own turning points, their own philosophical shifts. This framework we're using is very much about how Europe understood its own story, its connection to Greece and Rome, and how it saw itself evolving into the modern world. That's a really important perspective to keep in mind. So going back to that classical period, the Greeks and Romans, our sources highlight this distinct set of values appreciating art, architecture, literature, valuing individuals, and something called secular production. What did that actually look like? And how did it differ from what came next in the medieval period? Yeah, secular production is an interesting term. It basically refers to creations made for everyday life or for non religious purposes. But it points to a broader outlook, a valuing of human achievement, human reason and aesthetics beyond just the purely spiritual. So not everything was about the gods or the afterlife. Exactly. Think about the incredible Roman road network's practical infrastructure, spanning an empire, not just temples. Or the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, grappling with ethics, politics, how society should work, largely separate from divine commands. Even a grand temple like the Parthenon in Athens. Yes, it had a religious function, but look at the artistry. It's a monumental celebration of human ingenuity, engineering skill, aesthetic proportion, reason. A celebration of human capability. Precisely. The individual's capacity for reason, for creating beauty, for understanding the world. These things were valued and celebrated in a way that, as we'll definitely see, shifted quite dramatically in the next thousand years or so. Okay. And then comes this moment our sources pinpoint as a marker in time. Yeah, the fall of Rome in 476 CE. They're careful to say it wasn't like flipping a switch. Right. People didn't just wake up one day and say, well, I guess it's the Middle Ages now. Oh, absolutely not. It's a convenient date for historians. 476 CE, because that's when the last Western Roman emperor was deposed and the city of Rome itself had been sacked by various groups. Goths, Vandals, you name it. It effectively marks the end of centralized Roman political authority in much of Western Europe. But not a sudden collapse everywhere. No, not at all. For people living through it, it wouldn't have felt like a single overnight catastrophe. Think of it more as a long, slow unraveling that happened over generations. The Western Empire had been creaking under pressure for ages. Internal conflicts, economic problems, the strain of migrating peoples moving in from Central Asia and elsewhere. And the eastern part survived? Crucially, yes. The Eastern Roman Empire, which we often call the Byzantine Empire, centered on the magnificent city of Constantinople continued to thrive. It was a powerful, sophisticated, direct continuation of Roman traditions. And it lasted for another thousand years after 476. So the fall of Rome really refers to the gradual disintegration of political control in the West. It was messy, chaotic, and definitely not a clean break. So the term Middle Ages or medieval is really a label we put on it looking back. A way to make sense of this long, complex period of transition. Precisely. It's an analytical tool for us. Looking back with hindsight, if you were, say, a farmer in Gaul or resident of Rome in 476, you wouldn't see a news bulletin declaring classical era over Middle Ages begin. You'd just see things getting harder, maybe more dangerous, less predictable. As the old Roman structures faded and new localized powers started to emerge, often violently, life became more precarious. It's fascinating, though, how that ancient classical legacy, even after fading in the west, still echoes today. Our sources use this great example, comparing the Parthenon in Athens to the U.S. supreme Court building in Washington, D.C. why draw that parallel? What's the significance? It's a fantastic visual, isn't it? It really highlights this idea of historical continuity and, well, deliberate symbolic borrowing. The Supreme Court Building, like tons of other major government buildings in D.C. the Capitol, the White House to some extent, was built in what architects call a neoclassical style. Meaning new classical. Exactly. A conscious revival of ancient Greek and Roman architectural forms. The columns, the pediments, the sense of order and grandeur. The founders of the United States, who were steeped in Enlightenment thinking and deeply admired classical ideas of democracy and republicanism. Like the Roman Republic. Precisely. They deliberately chose this style for their new capital city. So it wasn't just about looking impressive. The actual buildings of the US Government carry these echoes, these messages from the ancient past. It's deeply symbolic, isn't it? Oh, profoundly symbolic. Think about it. The new United States was, well, new. It didn't have the centuries, the millennia of shared history and ancient lineage that European monarchies had. It needed legitimacy. Right. It needed to project stability and authority. Exactly. So by clothing their new institutions in the architectural language of classical Greece and Rome, the very birthplace of democracy and republic ideals, at least in the Western imagination, they were making a powerful statement. They were visually associating their fledgling nation with those venerable ancient ideals. It was an attempt to create a sense of historical weight, of ancient legitimacy for a brand new political experiment, its architecture as political communication, trying to give this new nation a gravitas it wouldn't otherwise have. That's fascinating. Okay, so from that Classical world with its focus on human reasons. Secular stuff. We move into this period of huge change. After the Western Roman empire fades around 476ce, it leaves this massive void in the West. You mentioned the East. Byzantium survived. What actually happened in the west when that Roman administrative structure just disappeared? Well, it was chaos, basically. Think about everything the Roman state at its height actually did. It provided the Pax Romana, the Roman peace. That meant a degree of security, protection from widespread crime, from brigands on the roads, from pirates on the seas. It built and maintained incredible infrastructure, roads, aqueducts, bridges. It managed complex logistics for food distribution, which was vital for feeding large cities. It handled basic civic functions, sanitation, record keeping. Things we take for granted today, maybe. Absolutely. When that central Roman government couldn't provide those services anymore in the West, a massive power vacuum opened up. Trade networks fractured, cities shrank dramatically as they couldn't be reliably supplied. Travel became incredibly dangerous, and everyday life for most people became very local and much more precarious. The stability was gone. And our sources say it was the Church that stepped into this void. They're very clear this wasn't some kind of, you know, evil plot for a power grab. So how did this happen? And what were the really big long term consequences of the Church taking on these administrative roles? That's such a crucial point. The Church didn't orchestrate some grand conspiracy. They stepped in largely because they were the only institution left with the organization, the literacy, the reach and the moral authority to provide some semblance of order and basic services when everything else was falling apart. They were the only ones still standing. In a way. In many ways, yes. Bishops often found themselves becoming de facto civic leaders. They'd negotiate with invading barbarian groups. They'd organize food relief for the starving. They'd try to maintain records, mediate disputes. It was a pragmatic, almost desperate response to the overwhelming societal need for someone to be in charge for some kind of stability in a world that felt like it was collapsing. But taking on those jobs had huge consequences. Immense. Because in taking over these vital, essentially secular administrative functions, the Church couldn't help but impose its own worldview. Its religious doctrines, its moral codes, its own hierarchical structure, its understanding of the universe. This Christian framework began to shape everything in Western Europe. So it wasn't just about religion anymore, it was about how society itself was run. Exactly. The Christian outlook gradually replaced the more secular values of the classical world. It wasn't just a spiritual shift, it was a fundamental reordering of society, where religious authority became Deeply intertwined, really inseparable from political and social power. This shaped the culture, the laws, the very identity of Western Europe for the next thousand years. And this period becomes known as the Christian era. But it's interesting, our sources mention that Europe, during much of this time, was actually considered something of a backwater compared to other civilizations like the Islamic world or China. Yet at the same time, it was developing this really intense sense of destiny. How did those two things, being a backwater and feeling destined for greatness, exist side by side? It's a fascinating paradox, isn't it? And it really speaks to the incredible power of belief systems. You're right. Compared to the flourishing Islamic caliphates with their vast trade networks and incredible scientific and cultural achievements, or imperial China, Western Europe was often politically fragmented, economically less developed, and periodically hammered by famines, plagues like the Black Death, and constant internal warfare. Not exactly a picture of strength. Not always, no. But intertwined with all that, the Church instilled this incredibly powerful unifying idea, the concept of the Empire of Christendom. The belief was that Christ was the ultimate ruler of a universal spiritual empire, and that it was the divine duty of Christians, of Europeans, to spread this empire, this faith, across the entire world. A divine mission? Absolutely. So even when they were struggling, maybe isolated, maybe relatively poor, they possessed this deep seated conviction, this powerful sense of divine purpose. They felt destined by God to eventually unify the world under their faith. And this conviction, this potent ideological fuel, would become incredibly important later on, providing a powerful justification for European existence, exploration, conquest and colonization. Even when they were venturing out from what was at the time, a relatively less powerful part of the world, it gave them a drive, a sense of purpose that arguably compensated for some of their material weaknesses. Wow. Okay. Speaking of that worldview, it led directly to a very specific, very rigid social structure in the Middle Ages. The three estates. Can you break that down for us? Who were these three groups? What were their supposed roles in this well ordered society? And what made these positions so incredibly fixed? Right, the three estates. It's a classic model of medieval society, at least in theory. Society was seen as divided into three distinct corporate bodies, or social layers, each supposedly ordained by God with a specific function. Like parts of a body working together. Exactly the idea. First you had the Bellator's. That literally means those who fight. These were the nobles, your kings, dukes, counts, knights, the whole aristocratic class. Their theoretical job was protection. They were meant to wield weapons, defend society from external enemies, keep internal order. Through military might, they controlled the land and commanded armies okay, the fighters, Estate number one, estate number two, the orators, those who pray. This was the clergy. Everyone from the pope at the very top down through cardinals, bishops, monks, nuns, and local parish priests. Their vital role was salvation. They were the intermediaries between God and humanity. They administered the sacraments, baptism, communion, confession, which were seen as absolutely essential for saving your soul and getting to heaven. So they held the keys to the afterlife. Basically, that was the belief, and it gave them immense power. In theory, they were positioned above the nobles, because for medieval people, eternal salvation was the ultimate trumping earthly power. The Pope, as the Vicar of Christ, Christ's representative on earth, held supreme spiritual authority and increasingly a lot of temporal political power too. Okay, fighters in pr. Who's the third estate? The third and by far the largest group were the obradors, those who work. These were overwhelmingly the peasants, the agricultural laborers, maybe 80, 90% of the population, sometimes more. Their role was support. They did the physical labor, primarily farming, to produce the food and goods needed to sustain all three estates. They worked the land. So fighters, prayers and workers. A neat triangle, in theory, yes. It was presented as this perfectly well ordered society, a divine blueprint where everyone had a specific place, a specific responsibility, and received certain benefits in return. And this theoretical structure was incredibly stable, lasting in various forms for roughly a thousand years. What made it so stable? Was it just the belief? It was God's plan. That was a huge part of it, the divine justification. But also the positions were incredibly fixed, largely determined by birth. If you were born a peasant, you expected to live and die a peasant, working the land your ancestors worked. If you were born noble, you trained for war, managed estates, married other nobles. There was very, very little concept of social mobility as we understand it today. Could a peasant become a priest? Yes, that was one potential path. But even then, rising to the highest levels of the Church, becoming a bishop or a cardinal was often difficult, as those positions frequently went to the younger sons of noble families who weren't going to inherit land, but still needed a prestig career. So even within the Church, hierarchy often reflected the social hierarchy outside it. This ties into the feudal system, Right, the whole structure of lords and peasants and land. Absolutely. The three estates model is the social theory. Feudalism is more the political and economic system that underpinned it, particularly in the countryside. Think of it as a pyramid of reciprocal obligations, though definitely not equal ones. How did that work practically? Okay, so at the top, notionally, is the king, who grants large tracts of land, called fiefs, to his most powerful nobles. His lords. In return for the land, the lord owes the king loyalty, military service providing knights for the king's army and council. Okay, then. That lord controls his fief. On that land live the peasants. The peasants work the land. A large portion of it, the demesne, is worked directly for the lord's benefit. The peasants owe the lord labor service, maybe several days a week working his fields, plus a hefty share of the crops they grow on the small strips of land they're allowed to use for themselves. They might also owe him fees for using his mill to grind their grain or his oven to bake bread. What did the peasants get in return? Theoretically. Theoretically, they got protection from the lord, protection from bandits from other invading lords, and the right to live on the land and sustain themselves. They also often had access to common lands for grazing animals or gathering firewood. It was a system of mutual, though highly unequal obligations, all based on land ownership and personal loyalty, tying people to the land and to their social superiors. It dictated almost every aspect of life for centuries. And you mentioned the Empire of Christendom. Again, this wasn't just a vague idea. It was a political concept too. How did the Pope and the nobles fit into that? Theoretically, yes. It was a powerful political and theological ideal, even if it never fully existed in practice as a unified state state. The theory was Christ is the ultimate king in heaven. The Pope is his earthly representative, the spiritual head, the vicar of Christ, guiding souls. The nobles, especially powerful figures like the Holy Roman Emperor, who ruled large parts of Germany and Italy, were seen as the sword of Christendom. The military arm. Exactly. Their duty wasn't just to rule their own lands, but to uphold Christian law, protect the church, defend Christendom from external threats like, say, Muslim powers or pagan groups, and crucially, to help spread this Christian empire. This is what made Christianity such a potent missionary force. It wasn't just about personal belief. It was about expanding a divinely ordained kingdom across the globe. The Crusades aimed at retaking the Holy Land, are probably the most famous example of this ideology in action. So even though Europe might have been fragmented and sometimes struggling, this powerful, religiously fueled sense of global destiny was brewing. It sounds like an almost perfect, divinely sanctioned, unbreakable system, but clearly it wasn't perfect. How did such a rigid, supposedly ideal structure end up breeding so much internal conflict and corruption that it eventually started to unravel? Ah, yes, that's the critical point. The gap between the theory of the well ordered society and the reality became enormous. While the model promised harmony and balance. In practice, our sources are pretty blunt. It became a lie. And this wasn't just, you know, a few bad apples. The systemic nature of the corruption and the failure to live up to the ideals created this deep well of cynicism, especially among those at the bottom. It didn't immediately cause revolution, but it made the whole structure incredibly fragile, eroding the moral legitimacy of the people in charge. A lie is a powerful accusation. What made it a lion practice? How did each estate fail to live up to its role? Let's take the nobles, the Bellator's. Their job was protection. But who did they mostly fight? Each other? Endless brutal wars over land, inheritance, titles. These wars devastated the countryside, disrupted harvests, and caused immense suffering for the peasants who were supposed to be protected. And who paid for these wars? The peasants, through taxes. Who got conscripted as foot soldiers? The peasants. So often, the protection offered by the nobles felt more like predation. Their focus was frequently on their own power and wealth, not the common good. Okay, so the protectors weren't always protecting the right people. What about the orators, the clergy? Their role was salvation. The clergy, especially the higher ups, bishops, archbishops, cardinals, became notorious for corruption. Remember, these positions often went to younger sons of noble families. They frequently saw Church office not as a spiritual calling, but as a lucrative career path, a way to gain immense wealth, land and political influence. So it wasn't always about religious devotion. Often, far from it. We hear accounts of bishops living like princes, throwing lavish parties, neglecting their spiritual duties entirely. Our sources even mention a period where the papacy itself became almost hereditary, with popes openly having families, violating their vows of celibacy, and appointing relatives to high priests positions. This blatant hypocrisy, this obvious pursuit of worldly power and pleasure by those who claimed to hold the keys to heaven, deeply undermine the Church's moral authority. How could you trust someone to guide your soul when they seemed so focused on enriching themselves? And the obradores, the peasants. They were stuck supporting this whole system, paying for the wars of the nobles and the luxury of the clergy. You said they knew it was a lie. If they knew, why didn't they just rise up sooner? Or did they resist in other ways? They certainly lacked the organized military power to effectively challenge the nobles who had the weapons in castles. And they lacked the ability to challenge the Church's spiritual authority directly. The Church controlled the path to salvation. And the threat of excommunication, of being cut off from God, was terrifying. A double whammy of control. Exactly. But knowing it was a lie didn't mean silent, passive acceptance. Resistance was often subtle. You see it in folktales and songs that mocked greedy priests or arrogant lords. You see it in court records detailing peasants dragging their feet on labor obligations, poaching game from the lord's forest, engaging in small acts of defiance. It was a simmering resentment, a deep seated cynicism that festered beneath the surface. This created a very receptive audience for radical new ideas. When the opportunity finally came, the foundations of trust were rotten. That raises a really important question then. If the system was bellators, orators, obradors, fighters, prayers, workers, who was missing from that neat little diagram? Was there anyone who didn't fit? And what impact did they have? That is such a critical point, and it points directly towards the future. The three states model worked best conceptually for a primarily rural agricultural society based on the feudal system. But it completely overlooked, or at least didn't account for, a growing and increasingly important group, the mercantile class, living in the towns and cities. Merchants, traders. Exactly. Merchants, bankers, skilled artisans organized into guilds, shopkeepers, traders. These people didn't fit neatly into the three categories. They weren't nobles fighting, they weren't sergi praying, though they were religious. And they weren't peasants working the land. They generated wealth through commerce, through trade, through finance, through making things. They often lived in self governing towns or communes which operated somewhat outside the direct control of feudal lords. And they were becoming more powerful, increasingly so, especially in places like the Italian city states, Venice, Florence, Genoa, or the cities of Flanders, Bruges, Ghent. They accumulated liquid wealth, actual money, not just land. They funded kings, financed explorations, fostered innovation. Yet they didn't have a clear, recognized place in the official, divinely ordained social structure. Their existence, their growing economic clout, their often more pragmatic, business oriented worldview, implicitly challenged the old order based on birth, land and religious hierarchy. They represented a different source of power, and their rise was a major sign that the old medieval system was becoming outdated, unable to contain the new economic realities. They were a key force pushing for change. Okay, so we have internal corruption, a growing class that doesn't fit the model. And then our sources bring up this fantastic analogy, the telephone game, to explain another subtle crack appearing how the Bible itself changed over time. How did the way the Bible was copied and translated contribute to weakening the Church's authority, especially when combined with this rising, often literate mercantile class? It's a brilliant analogy because it captures the process perfectly. Remember, for most of the Middle Ages, in the west. The standard Bible was the Vulgate, the Latin translation done by St. Jerome way back around 300 or 400 cells. Latin was the language of educated Romans then, but not the language of ordinary people a thousand years later. Exactly. And for that entire millennium, this Latin text was copied and recopied almost exclusively by hand by monks in monasteries scattered across Europe. Now, imagine playing telephone over a thousand years. Scribes were human. They made mistakes. Skipping lines, misspelling words. Sometimes they might add a little note in the margin, a clarification, and a later scribe might accidentally copy that note into the main text. Sometimes, maybe subconsciously, maybe deliberately, a scribe might change a word or phrase because they thought it sounded better or because it fit better with the theological understanding of their time, which might have subtly shifted over centuries. So the text itself wasn't stable. It wasn't perfectly stable. And the Church's doctrines, its practices, its claims to authority were all based on this evolving Latin text. The problem was, over time, these accumulated changes meant the Vulgate and the Church practices based on it began to diverge, sometimes significantly, from what scholars later discovered in older Greek and Hebrew manuscripts, which were believed to be closer to the original Scriptures. So when those older texts started reappearing exactly during the Renaissance, when scholars fleeing the east brought back older Greek manuscripts, or as humanist scholars started studying Hebrew more intensely, they could suddenly compare. They could hold up the current Church practices or the Standard Latin Bible and say, hang on, this passage in the older Greek text says something different. Or this practice doesn't seem to be supported by the earliest sources. This provided powerful textual ammunition for those questioning the Church's authority and its claims to be the sole infallible interpreter of God's word. It exposed a vulnerability right at the heart of the Church's legitimacy. The telephone game had consequences. So the stage is absolutely set. You've got this widespread, deeply felt corruption and hypocrisy. You've got this growing mercantile class that doesn't fit the old model. And now you have these subtle but profound questions arising about the very textual foundations of the Church's authority. It really feels like a pressure cooker just waiting to explode. Hashtag 2 the Renaissance and seeds of change. And that pressure cooker, that intellectual ferment, leads us right into the Renaissance, the rebirth. Our sources highlight a really specific event as a key catalyst and, interestingly, as the true end of the Roman Empire, the fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the Ottoman Turks. Why was that specific event happening way over in the east, so pivotal for Western Europe? It was hugely pivotal, as you said. Constantinople was the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, Byzantium. It had held out for almost a thousand years after the west collapsed. It was this vibrant center of learning, preserving so much ancient Greek and Roman knowledge. When the Ottoman Turks, a rising and incredibly powerful Islamic empire, finally conquered the city after a long siege in 1453, it sent shockwaves across Europe. But crucially, the scholars fled. Exactly. Scholars, artists, intellectuals, monks, anyone who could basically fled the crumbling city, fearing persecution or the destruction of their heritage under Ottoman rule. And where did they primarily flee? Westward to Italy, mainly, but also elsewhere in Christian Europe. And they brought their knowledge with them like intellectual refugees carrying treasures precisely like that. They brought with them literal treasures, chests full of ancient Greek manuscripts. Plato, Aristotle, Homer. Scientific texts, histories, mathematical treatises, things that had been largely lost or only known through imperfect Latin translations in the west for centuries. They also brought their own expertise, their ability to read and interpret these texts in the original Greek. This sudden massive injection of classical knowledge, art and philosophical ideas directly into Western Europe, particularly Italy, was the primary spark that ignited the Renaissance. Which literally means rebirth. Exactly. A rebirth of classical learning, classical artistic styles, classical humanism, the focus on human potential and achievement, and a more secular approach to inquiry after what was seen as centuries of relative intellect, sexual quietude in the West. And that brings us back to that term, the Dark Ages. Our sources mention it was really the later Enlightenment thinkers who slapped that label on the whole period between Rome's fall and the Renaissance. Why did they see it as dark? What was their perspective, looking back? Well, you have to remember the Enlightenment self image. They saw themselves as champions of reason, science, progress and human liberty. Looking back from the 17th and 18th centuries, they viewed the long stretch from roughly 476 to 1453 as a period dominated by religious dogmas, superstition, violence, and a general lack of scientific progress or appreciation for the secular, human centered values they associated with the classical world, Greece and Rome. So they saw it as a backward step? Very much so. They perceived it as an era where human potential was suppressed, where life was often brutal and short, a veil of tears endured only in hope of the afterlife. They believed that the focus was almost exclusively on salvation and religious authority, often at the expense of critical thinking, scientific inquiry, or artistic expression for its own sake. So they labeled it the Dark Ages, a long, dark interval between the light of classical antiquity and the new light of their own Age of Reason. It was a way of defining themselves against the immediate past, constructing a narrative of human progress, being rediscovered that makes sense. So this flood of rediscovered knowledge during the Renaissance, especially the more accurate ancient texts, including original language Bibles, this must have posed a massive, direct challenge to the Church's narrative right, to its authority, which had been built on centuries of being the sole interpreter, the gatekeeper of knowledge. Oh, absolutely. It was an intellectual earthquake. The Renaissance wasn't just about painting beautiful pictures or building classically inspired churches, though. It was that too. It brought back the tools for critical thinking, for textual analysis, for questioning assumptions. Tools the Church had controlled. Largely, yes. And crucially, as you mentioned, it brought back more accurate versions of foundational texts. Not just Plato and Aristotle, but Biblical scriptures in the original Greek and Hebrew. Suddenly, scholars and increasingly literate laypeople could compare the Church's official Latin Vulgate Bible and the practices based upon it with what seemed to be older, more authentic versions, and they could see the differences. The telephone game effect. They could see the discrepancies. They could point to passages where the meaning seemed different or where later traditions seem to have crept in. This allowed people to assert, with growing confidence in textual evidence, that maybe the Church wasn't always acting according to the original Scriptures, or that some of its interpretations developed over centuries might be flawed or self serving. That's a huge challenge to authority. It's fundamental. For centuries, the Church had held a near monopoly on truth, controlling access to Scripture, interpreting it for the masses. Now that monopoly was being broken, the Renaissance unleashed this intellectual ferment, this spirit of critical inquiry that directly questioned the Church's unchallenged power and legitimacy. It laid the essential groundwork for the religious revolution that was about to explode. The Reformation. It empowered individual conscience and individual reading in a way that hadn't really been possible on a large scale for a thousand years. Okay, so that intellectual ferment, that questioning spirit sparked by the Renaissance, sets the stage perfectly for the Reformation. Truly a seismic shift. And our sources focus on one man whose personal struggle really ignited the whole thing. Martin Luther. Now, here's where it gets really interesting. We need to be clear. This is not the Martin Luther King Jr. Of the American civil rights movement. Right. Very different. Martin Luther about 450 years earlier, but also a figure who profoundly changed the world. Absolutely. Our sources describe this Martin Luther as a German Catholic priest, an Augustinian monk, actually, who was deeply, personally tormented by his own sense of sinfulness, his fear of God's judgment. Can you walk us through how his intense personal quest for salvation turned into a revolutionary theology that ended up splintering Western Christianity forever? Yeah. Luther's personal story is key to understanding the Reformation's origins. He was, by all accounts, incredibly devout, but also deeply troubled. He lived in constant fear of damnation. He tried everything the Church recommended. Rigorous fasting, prayer, endless confession, pilgrimage, self punishment. But none of it brought him peace. He felt perpetually unworthy, unable to meet God's righteous standards through his own efforts or through the Church's rituals. How could a flawed human ever satisfy a perfect God? An existential crisis, really? Absolutely. And then, through his intensive study of the Bible, particularly St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans. And significantly, he was reading it with the new humanist tools of textual analysis learned during the Renaissance. He had this breakthrough, this moment of profound insight. What was the breakthrough? He came to believe that salvation wasn't earned through good works or sacraments or anything humans could do. Instead, it was a free gift from God, received solely through faith in Jesus Christ. Justification, being made right with God, came by faith alone. Sola fidelity, as the Latin phrase goes. Not by works, not by rituals, just by believing, just by trusting in God's grace, which was freely given. And crucially, he argued that this saving faith came directly from hearing or reading the Word of God, the Bible itself. The individual believer could have a direct relationship with God through Scripture without necessarily needing the Church hierarchy. The priests, the bishops, the Pope acting as intermediaries. Wow, that sounds simple, but it's utterly revolutionary. Against the backdrop of the medieval Church, it was dynamite. It struck directly at the heart of the Church's power and identity. The Church taught that salvation required its sacraments, administered by its ordained clergy. It taught that it was the necessary mediator between God and humanity. It also insisted that it held the sole authority to interpret the Bible correctly, fearing that ordinary people reading it for themselves would fall into error and heresy. So Luther was basically saying the Church hierarchy wasn't essential for the most important thing, salvation? Essentially, yes. He was radically empowering the individual believer and diminishing the institutional necessity of the Church structure. He wasn't just questioning practices. He was questioning the fundamental role and authority of the Church in the process of salvation. This inevitably put him on a collision course with Rome. And that collision came, famously with his 95 theses, which targeted the practice of selling indulgences. He supposedly nailed them to a church door in Wittenberg. Tell us about indulgences. What were they? And why did they become such a flashpoint, such a symbol of corruption? For Luther, right, the 95 theses in 1517 are the iconic starting point. And indulgences were the Perfect trigger, because they seemed to perfectly embody the spiritual corruption and financial exploitation Luther was railing against. Okay, so in Catholic theology, even after your sins are forgiven through confession, you might still need to undergo temporal punishment, either in this life or in purgatory after death, to purify your soul before entering heaven. Okay. Sort of spiritual cleansing, kind of penance, doing good works, prayer, pilgrimage. These could help reduce that time in Purgatory. An indulgence was essentially a remission of this temporal punishment granted by the Church under certain conditions. So far, maybe not too controversial. Well, where it became hugely controversial was how it evolved. By the late Middle Ages, it became increasingly common for the Church to grant indulgences in return for financial donations. People could essentially buy an indulgence to reduce their own time in Purgatory, or even for their dead relatives already believed to be there. Buying time off Purgatory. That's exactly how it looked and how it was often marketed. There was a particularly aggressive campaign underway in Germany around Luther's time, led by a man named Johann Tetzel, to raise money for the massive rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Tetzel's sales pitch was notoriously crass. He supposedly used a jingle, maybe apocryphal, but it captures the spirit. As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from Purgatory springs. Wow, that's blatant. Like a heavenly get out of jail free card for cash. It struck Luther and many others as utterly profane, a grotesque distortion of God's grace and true repentance. He saw it as exploiting people's deepest fears for financial gain. He argued furiously that there was absolutely no biblical basis for the idea that salvation or relief from punishment could be bought with money. If the Pope truly had the power to release souls from purgatory, Luther famously argued in the Theses, he should do it out of Christian love and charity for free, not sell it like a market vendor. So the 95 theses weren't just abstract theology. They were a direct attack on a major church fundraising scheme and the theology behind it. Absolutely. It hit a nerve because it seemed to perfectly crystallize the lie we talked about earlier, the gap between the Church's spiritual claims and its often very worldly, very financial operations. It tapped into widespread resentment about Church wealth and corruption. Now, other people had challenged the Church before Luther. You mentioned Jan Hus in Bohemia a century earlier, who was burned at the stake for heresy. But Luther, despite being condemned, despite being excommunicated, survived. How did he manage that and how crucial was his survival for the Reformation actually taking off? Luther's survival is one of those pivotal moments where politics and religion intersect dramatically. It was absolutely critical. If he'd been silenced or executed early on, like Hus, the Reformation might have fizzled out or taken a very different path. So what saved him? Primarily political protection. Unlike Huss, Luther had a powerful secular protector, Frederick iii, the Elector of Saxony, often known as Frederick the Wise. Frederick was one of the most important princes within the Holy Roman Empire, the loose confederation of German states. Why did Frederick protect him? Was he a secret Lutheran? Not necessarily. At least not initially. Frederick's motives were likely complex and primarily political. He resented the flow of German money to Rome through things like indulgence sales. He saw protecting Luther, this popular German theologian, challenging papal authority, as a way to assert his own political independence and influence against both the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, who wanted Luther suppressed. It was a power play, using Luther as leverage. Pretty much. After Luther famously refused to recant his writings at the Diet of Worms in 1521, saying, Here I stand, I can do no other, he was declared an outlaw. But Friedrich staged a fake kidnapping and hid Luther away in Wartburg Cassie for nearly a year. Wow. Like something out of a movie. Totally. And crucially, while in hiding, Luther used the time to translate the New Testament from Greek into German. This was monumental. It put the Bible directly into the hands of ordinary German speaking people in their own language, bypassing the Church's Latin monopoly and reinforcing his core idea of salvation through personal faith grounded in Scripture. Frederick's protection gave Luther the time and safety to solidify his theology and spread his ideas through the relatively new technology of the printing press. So his survival wasn't just luck. It was about the changing political winds. The growing power of these regional princes willing to defy the Pope and Emperor. Exactly. It showed that the monolithic authority of the medieval church was starting to crack, that secular rulers now had the power and sometimes the political will to shield dissenters. Without Frederick the Wise, the Reformation as we know it probably wouldn't have happened. Okay, so Luther survives. His message spreads like wildfire, partly thanks to the printing press. And it clearly resonated deeply, especially with the peasants, who saw him as someone finally speaking truth to power about the corruption they lived under. But this led to massive peasant uprisings, which, kind of ironically, Luther himself condemned really harshly. What was his reasoning there? And how did his actions, even if he didn't intend revolution, lead to this permanent split in the Church? And this big power shift towards secular rulers. Yeah, the peasant war of 1524, 1525, is a really complex and tragic part of the story. Luther's message, challenging the authority of the Pope and bishops, talking about Christian freedom, condemning the greed of the elites, was interpreted by many deeply oppressed peasants as a call not just for religious reform, but for social and economic justice too. They drew up demands based on Scripture, calling for an end to serfdom, unfair taxes and the privileges of the nobles and clergy. They saw Luther as their champion, but he rejected their cause. He did, vehemently. Luther was fundamentally conservative when it came to social order. He believed strongly that earthly rulers, the princes and magistrates, were ordained by God to maintain peace and order, even if they were unjust. He saw the peasants rebellion as chaotic, violent and an offense against God's ordained structure for society. His goal was to reform the Church, not to overthrow the entire social and political system. He wrote pamphlets brutally condemning the revolt, urging the princes to smite, slay and stab the rebellious peasants. That sounds incredibly harsh. It must have alienated a lot of his initial supporters among the common people. It absolutely did. Many peasants felt betrayed, but by then, the genie was out of the bottle. Luther's core theological challenges salvation by faith alone, Scripture as the sole authority, the priesthood of all believers had taken root and spread far beyond his control. The established church, meanwhile, proved incapable of reforming itself fundamentally enough to accommodate these radical ideas. It was too invested in its power structure, its traditions, its control over sacraments and interpretation. So a reconciliation wasn't possible? It seems not. The theological gap was too wide and the institutional resistance too strong. The result was an irreparable schism. Luther, whether he intended it or not, effectively broke the Church. The unity of Western Christendom under the Pope was shattered. And this fragmentation created an opportunity for the nobles. A massive opportunity. Suddenly, the princes and kings of Europe had huge new leverage against the Pope. They could now play the Protestant card. They could pressure the Vatican for concessions, demanding more control over Church appointments and finances within their territories, for example. Or they could go further and threaten to break away entirely, declare their lands Protestant, confiscate wealthy church properties and place the Church within their territory, under their own control. A huge power shift from church to state. Monumental. This led directly to a significant rise in the power of secular rulers and a corresponding decline in the political authority of the papacy. It helped pave the way for the modern nation state. The principle of cuis regio eis religio, whose realm his religion emerged from. The religious wars that followed it meant the local ruler, the prince, got to decide whether his territory would be Catholic or Lutheran or later, Calvinist religion became subordinate to political power in a way it hadn't been for a thousand years. And the Catholic Church's response to all this was the Council of Trent. Did that manage to heal the split, or did it just solidify the division? The Council of Trent, which met on and off for about 18 years in the mid 16th century, was the Catholic Church's big formal response, sometimes called the Counter Reformation or the Catholic Reformation. On one hand, it was successful in enacting major internal reforms. It cracked down hard on corruption, condemned the selling of indulgences, though not the concept itself, mandated better education and discipline for priests, and generally cleaned up many of the abuses that Luther had initially attacked. This internal renewal was vital for the Catholic Church's survival and future vitality. But it didn't bring the Protestants back. No. On the crucial theological issues, Trent doubled down. It forcefully reaffirmed the necessity of both faith and good works for salvation, the essential role of the seven sacraments, the authority of church tradition alongside Scripture, and, critically, the Pope's supreme authority and the Church's exclusive right to interpret the Bible, the teaching magisterium. It explicitly rejected Luther's core doctrines of sola fide and sola scriptura. So it basically drew a very clear line in the sand. Exactly. It clarified Catholic doctrine, reformed internal abuses, but it made reconciliation with the Protestants theologically impossible. It cemented the schism. From then on, you had a distinct Catholic Church and a growing number of Protestant churches, which, because of the emphasis on individual interpretation of Scripture, quickly began fragmenting themselves into various denominations. Lutherans, Calvinists, Anglicans, Anabaptists, Baptists, and eventually many, many more. It's fascinating, isn't it, how quickly that seemingly monolithic unity of Christendom just fractured. It wasn't just a theological debate anymore. It redrew the map of Europe, creating this complex tapestry of different beliefs, often living uneasily side by side. Or worse. Or worse. Because this religious fragmentation didn't just stay in the churches or universities, it spilled violently into politics and warfare. Consequences in a new year. So this shattering of Christian unity, this fragmentation into Catholic and various Protestant groups, what were the immediate, tangible consequences? Our sources paint a grim picture. An era of widespread, incredibly brutal and destructive religious warfare that tore Europe apart for more than a century. Can you describe what these wars were like? They were truly horrific, often characterized by a level of brutality and ideological fervor that Europe hadn't seen before, or perhaps since in quite the same way, these weren't just typical dynastic squabbles over territory, though those motives were certainly mixed in. At their core, these were wars driven by fundamental disagreements about religious truth, about the correct path to salvation. Existential complex, really. Exactly. Each side often genuinely believed the other was not just wrong, but heretical, leading souls to damnation, doing the devil's work. This gave the conflicts in us versus Them existential intensity. Think about the French wars of religion between Catholics and Huguenots, French Protestants, culminating in massacres like St. Bartholomew's Day, or the Dutch revolt against Catholic Spain. Or the most devastating of all, the Thirty Years War 1618-1648 that ravaged Central Europe, particularly the German lands. What made them so destructive? Several factors. Armies were larger, gunpowder weapons more prevalent. But also the ideological nature meant that civilian populations were often targeted. If a town was deemed heretical, it might be subject to massacre or brutal occupation. Armies lived off the land, leading to widespread famine and economic collapse. Disease ran rampant in the wake of armies and displaced populations. In some parts of Germany during the Thirty Years War, the population may have dropped by a third or even half due to violence, starvation and plague. Generations were lost. It was apocalyptic for many regions, and you mentioned they were largely unwinnable. Why? Because you can't ultimately force genuine religious conversion at the point of a sword. People's core beliefs about God and salvation are often incredibly deep seated. As our source material kind of bluntly puts it, people on all sides were often willing to die or kill for their faith. Think about the level of commitment required for martyrdom. You can conquer territory, you can impose political control, but changing hearts and minds through violence, largely impossible. This led to endless cycles of warfare, destruction and exhaustion with no clear victor emerging, just widespread suffering. It sounds absolutely devastating, that idea of toleration of different religions just agreeing to disagree and coexist peacefully. That just wasn't on the table back then, almost entirely absent. The prevailing mindset for both Catholics and most Protestants at the time was that religious uniformity within a state was essential for social order and divine favor. Having people practicing the wrong religion was seen as dangerous, offensive to God, and a threat to the community's salvation. The duty was often seen as either converting them, expelling them, or in extreme cases, killing them. The modern idea of religious freedom as a fundamental right simply didn't exist for most people. It took centuries of bloodshed for ideas of toleration to gradually, painfully emerge. So connecting this to the bigger picture, these weren't just standard wars over land or resources. They were fought over belief itself, making them uniquely brutal and ultimately futile, leaving this deep psychological scar on Europe. Absolutely. The sheer scale of the suffering, the realization that these wars were unwinnable and were destroying the very fabric of society, eventually led to a profound sense of exhaustion and disillusionment across Europe. People started slowly, tentatively, to question whether religious uniformity was worth the horrific price. It was a traumatic lesson learned at an almost unimaginable human cost. And yet it's one of history's great ironies, isn't it? Out of that darkness, out of that suffering and destruction, came some truly profound, often unintended consequences that would completely reshape European society in secular ways. A huge surge in popular literacy and the birth of modern nationalism. How on earth did religious conflict lead to more people reading and the rise of nations? It seems counterintuitive, but the connection is quite direct, especially regarding literacy. Remember the core Protestant idea, particularly Luther's salvation by faith alone? And that faith comes from engaging directly with the Bible. Right, So l'. Scriptura. Scripture alone. Exactly. If you genuinely believed that reading or hearing the Bible in your own language was essential for your eternal soul, you suddenly had the most powerful motivation imaginable to learn how to read. This wasn't just for scholars or elites anymore. It was for everyone. Protestant reformers actively promoted literacy and education precisely so people could read the Bible. This led to a massive surge in demand for schools, for primers, and, of course, for Bibles printed in the vernacular languages. So the Reformation itself was a huge engine for literacy. A massive engine. And once people become literate, they don't only read the Bible, do they? Ah, right. Once you can read, you can read anything. Precisely. They could read different interpretations of the Bible. Calvin's, Zwingli's. They could read pamphlets, argue about politics. They could read emerging scientific ideas. They could read the radical works of early Enlightenment thinkers who were starting to question everything. So this religious impulse to read the Bible unintentionally opened the door to a much wider world of ideas, fostering critical thinking and intellectual engagement across society on an unprecedented scale. The printing press, arriving just before the Reformation, acted as a massive amplifier for all this. That's incredible. So the quest for personal salvation inadvertently fueled mass education and intellectual revolution. What about nationalism? How did common language Bibles lead to the idea of France or England as nations? This is another fascinating, somewhat slower, burning consequence. Before the Reformation, the main unifying force across Western Europe, overriding local loyalties, was Christendom. The Catholic Church, using Latin as its universal Language, your primary identity might be as a Christian, maybe then as a subject of the Duke of Burgundy or a resident of a particular village. Not necessarily as French or German in the modern sense. Not in the same way, no. But when Luther translated the Bible into German or Tyndale into English or others into French or Spanish, they needed to choose a specific dialect of that language to print. Luther's Bible, for instance, hugely influential, helped to standardize High German. The King James Bible did something similar for English. So printing created standard languages. It massively contributed to it over generations, as more and more people read the same foundational text, the Bible, in the same standardized vernacular language, attended church services in that language, read pamphlets and ballads in that language. It fostered a powerful sense of shadow, shared identity, a common culture distinct from people speaking different languages across the border. We speak and read like this. They don't. Exactly. This linguistic and cultural unity, often reinforced by the political boundaries being drawn by princes choosing a specific religion, Cuis regio, gradually helped to forge a new kind of collective identity, national identity. The idea of being English, French, Swedish, Spanish began to gain strength, often replacing or overlaying older loyalties to a local lord or even the universal church. So nationalism wasn't some ancient, inherent thing. It developed. Absolutely. It's largely a modern construct. And the religious and linguistic shifts of the Reformation era played a huge role in its development. As the unifying authority of the church declined, the nation state, defined by language, culture, and increasingly, secular political loyalty, rose to take its place as the primary focus of identity for many people. If you look at a map of Europe around 1500, it's a fragmented patchwork. A map from 1700 or 1800 looks much more like the nation states we recognize. It was a profound transformation in how people conceived of themselves and their communities. Wow. Okay. So literacy and nationalism as unintended consequences. And finally, these horrific religious wars had one more major impact, perhaps the most profound in terms of intellectual history. They pushed a group of thinkers to look at all the bloodshed and basically reject traditional religion as the basis for society leading directly to the Enlightenment. Yes. This is the final crucial piece of the puzzle connecting this era to the next. The sheer scale and brutality of the religious wars, lasting for generations, deeply traumatized the European psyche. It led a group of intellectuals, who we now call the philosophers of the Enlightenment, to look at the carnage. Catholics killing Protestants, Protestants killing Catholics. Endless, futile violence committed in the name of God, and ask some very hard questions like, is this really what God wants? Exactly. Is this endless slaughter, this intolerance this destruction truly the result of divine command? Or is there something fundamentally flawed with basing society and morality on competing dogmatic religious claims that lead to such conflict? They began to suggest that maybe humanity needed a different foundation for knowledge, for ethics, for government, one based on human reason, observation, science and natural law, rather than revelation or religious authority seeking order through reason, not faith. Because faith seemed to lead to chaos. That was very much the impulse for many of them. They consciously defined their own age of reason or enlightenment, in direct opposition to what they perceived as the darkness and superstition of the preceding religious era, the Middle Ages. They saw themselves as emerging from centuries of faith based conflict into a new era illuminated by human intellect. They wanted to understand the universe and organize society based on observable principles and rational thought, hoping to build a more peaceful, tolerant and progressive world, free from the destructive religious fanaticism they had witnessed. It's incredible how that collective trauma of religious war pushed thought towards secularism, towards reason, towards science as alternatives. It was a pivotal turning point. The suffering caused by religious certainty ironically drove a profound shift towards skepticism, empirical inquiry and humanism. It didn't mean everyone stopped being religious, far from it. But it fundamentally challenged the idea that traditional religious authority should hold ultimate sway over all aspects of life, knowledge and politics. It opened the door wide for the scientific revolution and the full flowering of Enlightenment thought, which would in turn utterly reshape Europe and the world once again. Outro, wow, we have covered a lot of ground today, haven't we? It's quite a journey from thinking about Europe as this theoretically unified Christian entity under the Church, even if flawed, right, that idea of Christendom to seeing it grapple with deep, deep corruption, then splinter intellectually during the Renaissance and finally shatter completely during the Reformation, leading to centuries of brutal religious warfare that redrew the map and redefined identity. It's a dramatic arc, no question. We saw how rediscovering ancient knowledge helped spark it all. How one monk's crisis of faith, Martin Luther's, could ignite a continent wide firestorm. And how that firestorm, meant to be about religious reform, ended up empowering secular princes, unexpectedly driving mass literacy, and even planting the seeds for modern nationalism. And if you connect all those threads, what really stands out is how incredibly interconnected historical forces are. You can't separate the theology from the politics, the economics, from the social structure, the technology, like the printing press, from the spread of ideas. It's all tangled together completely. Those intense theological debates about faith versus works, or who gets to interpret the Bible. They weren't just happening in dusty libraries. They had massive real world consequences. They reshaped political power structures. They fostered entirely new ways for people to see themselves as members of a nation, not just just a local village or universal church. And they ultimately challenged the very foundations of belief, paving the way for the Enlightenment's turn towards reason. Ideas really do have consequences. So thinking about all that, here's maybe a final provocative thought to leave you with. If a societal order that lasted a thousand years, an order based on such deeply ingrained religious beliefs, such rigid social structures, could be so radically overturned, so completely fragmented by a few powerful ideas, by technological change, and by the conflicts that followed, yeah, what does that tell us about the resilience, or maybe the inherent fragility of the institutions, the ideologies, the beliefs that define our own world today? Are the things we take for granted as stable, potentially more vulnerable to disruption than we think? That's a heavy question to end on, but a really important one. History does show that periods of seeming stability can unravel surprisingly quickly when the underlying conditions change, or when power, powerful new ideas emerge. Something to definitely chew on. We really encourage you to think about how those historical tremors we've discussed today, the struggles over authority, identity, belief, the impact of new information, might still be echoing in our modern world, in our politics, our societies, our own conflicts. It invites you to look a bit deeper, maybe at the sources of unity and division all around us. History isn't just about the past. It's always speaking to the present. Couldn't agree more. Well, thanks for joining us for this deep dive into a truly transformative period.

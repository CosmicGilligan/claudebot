Welcome to the deep dive. Today we're jumping into an era that, well, it fundamentally changed everything. How we see the world, our place in it, even this idea of freedom that feels so, you know, normal to us now. It really does feel normal, doesn't it? Yeah, but it wasn't always the default. The idea that we as humans can actually reshape society using reason, that was incredibly radical stuff back then. Absolutely. And that's what we're doing today. A real deep dive into the Enlightenment. This period gave birth to these, well, revolutionary ideas that formed the bedrock of our world. Exactly. We're going to unpack how thinkers centuries ago started asking these huge questions, questioning everything really, and how those questions led to democracy, human rights, capitalism. But also some really complex challenges we're still wrestling with. Think of this as maybe the essential guide. Understanding the Enlightenment helps you understand the framework of modern society, the good and the bad. We'll hit questions like how do people shift from faith to reason as the main source of truth? Yeah. And what were those really earth shattering ideas about who should rule? And maybe even more fundamentally, how do people become who they are? Is it fixed or is it something we can shape and then trace? How these really optimistic ideas, this dream of a human made paradise, almost crashed into the realities of the 20th century. Its story of huge hope meeting. Well, some devastating roadblocks. It really is. It fundamentally changed how we even think about the word progress. Okay, so to really get this, we need to set the scene. Where did the Enlightenment even come from? Context is everything here. It is. Historians place it in the modern era of Western history, which sounds obvious, but it's distinct from the classical era. Think Greece and Rome and the Medieval period, you know, Middle Ages dominated by the Church. So? So it's not just a date on a timeline. It's a whole reorientation of thinking about truth, power, the individual, everything. A massive reorientation. Yeah. And you can't understand it without looking at what immediately preceded it. The chaos after the Reformation. Ugh. Martin Luther, 1517, the 95 Theses nailed the Church door. That really kicked things off, didn't it? It absolutely did. It wasn't just a theological argument. It shattered the religious unity of Europe. Protestants versus Catholics. This split wasn't just spiritual, it was deeply political. Right, because back then church and state were so intertwined. You mentioned Carlos V, the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. Figures like that held immense power, partly derived from the Church. He was called the Sword of Christendom. Exactly. He embodied that fusion of religious and secular Authority. So when the Church itself fractured, it wasn't just a crisis of faith. It was a massive political earthquake. It destabilized the entire continent and created a power vacuum. Precisely. Ambitious princes, nobles, they saw an opportunity. The Pope's authority was weakened, and they could gain more power for themselves by choosing sides, essentially. Which led to that principle. Quies regio is religio. Yes. Whose realm? His religion. A chillingly simple concept, really. If your ruler was Protestant, you became Protestant. If they were Catholic, you became Catholic. End of story. So zero individual choice in religion. Absolutely none. Your eternal soul depended on who happened to be wearing the crown. It's hard to even imagine now. It is. And it's the absolute opposite of the Enlightenment ideas about individual conscience that would come later. Imagine your deepest beliefs being dictated by political succession, and then you throw in the discovery of the Americas. Suddenly there's this massive influx of wealth. Gold, silver, unprecedented wealth flowing into Europe, especially to rulers like Carlos V. And what do they often use it for? To fund armies to try and enforce religious uniformity, to fight these religious wars. So you have deep religious conviction, absolute political power, new money, and a fractured continent. Recipe for disaster. A recipe for over a century of brutal, devastating warfare. The Thirty Years War, for example, just decimated parts of Central Europe. These weren't just political squabbles. They were wars of annihilation, fuel fueled by the belief that the other side was fundamentally wrong, maybe even evil, and needed to be converted or eliminated. And people were willing to die for these beliefs. Martyrdom was a real factor, a huge factor. People genuinely believed they were fighting for God, for salvation. That makes these conflicts incredibly difficult, almost impossible to resolve through force. You can't easily bomb someone into changing their faith. The problem, the thinkers who came later realized, was the coercion itself, mixing state power and religious belief. Okay, so that's the backdrop. A century of chaos, bloodshed, religious intolerance tearing Europe apart. It's out of this that the Enlightenment thinkers, the philosophies, emerge. Yes, mostly in the 17th century, particularly in France. They looked at this endless, destructive conflict and asked, what's the root cause? And their answer was startling. It was incredibly radical. They concluded the problem wasn't this specific religion or that one. The problem, they argued, was religion itself being the basis for authority, for truth in the public square. They saw it as inherently divisive when tied to power. Wow. Given that religion had been the source of truth for what, forever? That's a monumental claim to say it's the problem. Exactly. Turned thousands of years of thinking on its head. But crucially, they weren't just diagnosing the problem in a vacuum. Something else was happening simultaneously. Science, Science, a whole new way of understanding the world was, was gaining serious traction, based not on faith or ancient texts, but on observation, experimentation, evidence. Like Isaac Newton, his Principia Mathematica in 1687, that laid out universal laws. Right. Show the universe wasn't just random divine acts, but operated according to predictable principles. Precisely. It suggested a rational, understandable cosmos. And this offered the philosophs an alternative foundation for truth. This leads to that key shift, what you could call the truth paradigm shift. Okay, explain that. Pre modern versus modern truth. Right, Pre modern. The foundation of truth is religion. The basis is faith. I believe because it's revealed. Essentially, the language is scripture, like the Bible. Okay. Then comes the Enlightenment shift. The foundation starts moving towards science. The basis becomes reason. Using your senses, your brain to observe and analyze the world. And the language becomes mathematics. Universal, logical. It's a totally different way of knowing how we know things. Think about Galileo getting in trouble because his observations contradicted the Bible. Exactly. The new idea was maybe observation and reason can tell us truths even if they clash with scripture. And the philosophes didn't stop at planets and stars. They applied it to society itself. Yes. They thought, if we can use reason to understand the laws of physics, why can't we use reason to understand the laws of human society, to figure out the best way to live, to govern? That's why it's called the Age of reason. And that's left a huge legacy, hasn't it, this cultural trust in science? Absolutely. Even today, culturally, we tend to default to what does the science say? Think about debates on climate change, medicine. The ultimate appeal is awesome to scientific evidence. That deep seated trust has its roots right here. But this wasn't an overnight switch, right? Flipping from faith to reason? Not at all. It was a long, slow burn. Centuries really, starting maybe mid 17th century. And arguably we've only seen a real questioning of that scientific dominance in the last, say, 50 years or so. And literacy played a role. You mentioned the Reformation encouraged reading the Bible. Yeah, kind of an unintended consequence. If you teach people to read the Bible, they can also read, well, other things, pamphlets, books by thinkers like John Locke. Ideas started spreading beyond the clergy and the elites. Okay, let's talk about Locked. You mention him. He sounds like a central figure. Absolutely pivotal and genuinely radical for his time. His ideas, which seem foundational to us, were incredibly left wing, deeply threatening to the monarchies and churches of 17th century Europe. Honestly, he makes some modern progressives look conservative in comparison to the context he was writing in. Let's get specific. His letter concerning toleration from 1689. What was so radical about that? Well, remember the context in England, Constant violent swings between Protestantism and Catholicism. Bloody Marys burning Protestants, then Protestant rulers persecuting Catholics. It was chaos, just non stop religious conflict tied to whoever was king or queen. Okay, and Locke's take? He wasn't conventionally religious, was he? No, he was a deist. Believed God created the world like a clock Major, set it running with natural laws, gave humans reason to understand it, but then stepped back. No miracles, no direct intervention. God give us the tools, observation and reason to figure things out ourselves. So how did that influence his view on toleration? His argument was basically, since specific religious doctrines are, from a rational perspective, matters of personal belief, maybe even superstition, and you can't force genuine belief anyway, the government should just stay out of it completely. Keep government out of religion. That sounds normal now, but back then, revolutionary. For all of history. Rulers claimed divine right, churches backed states, states enforced religious conformity. Locke saying the government has no business interfering in personal faith, that the state should tolerate different beliefs, even ones it thinks are wrong. That was the seed of religious freedom, the separation of church and state that America and much of the west later adopted. Wow. Okay. But he didn't stop at religion and government. He tackled human nature itself. He did in his essay concerning human understanding, also 1689. He went right after the traditional Christian idea of original sin, that humans are born flawed, stained, needing divine grace to be good. And his alternative was the tabula rasa, the blank slate. He argued we're born with no innate ideas, no inherent sin or virtue. Our minds are like empty chalkboards at birth. So everything we become is written on that slate by experience. Exactly what you see, hear, learn, the society you grow up in, that's what shapes you. If you never experience freedom, you won't value it. If you're taught reason, you become reasonable. If you're taught prejudice, you become prejudice. That has huge implications. If humans are blank slaves, then you can create the kind of people you want through education, through shaping their environment and experiences. This is the core of the Enlightenment project. Really create enlightened beings and then an enlightened society. That was the dream. A society built on reason, knowledge, virtue. And notice the implication humans can achieve fulfillment, maybe even perfection without God's direct intervention, through our own efforts through reason and education. So state education Today its goal isn't religious indoctrination, but shaping citizens based on certain arguably Enlightenment derived values. You could absolutely argue that it's about instilling knowledge, critical thinking, civic virtue, aiming to create a functional, enlightened society based on that Lockean premise that you can shape the slate. Okay, Shaping individuals leads to shaping society. Which brings us to his political ideas. The Second Treatise on Civil Government, 1689. Again, what's the core idea there? Popular sovereignty. Simple phrase, radical, meaning the people rule, not kings, not God directly, but the people. That's a direct attack on the divine right of kings. Absolutely. The idea that monarchs had a God given right to rule, that they had special noble blood. Locke asks, where does a ruler's legitimate authority actually come from? His answer, from the consent of the governed. The people delegate power to the government. And why do they delegate that power? What's the government's purpose? According to Locke, solely to protect private property. And that's crucial. Property for Locke wasn't just land. It was your life, your liberty and your estate, what you produce, what you own, your very self. That's the government's job, protect those inherent rights. And if the government fails to do that, or worse, violates those rights, then the people have the right to get rid of that government, to revolt. Because the government has broken the contract, it's failed its only legitimate purpose. It's not just a right, it's almost a duty to overthrow tyranny. And that idea that lit the fuse for revolutions. Absolutely. The American Revolution drew directly on Locke for its justification. Why could they break from Britain? Because the king, they argued, had violated their natural rights, their property in the law. Can sense it fueled revolutions across the Americas and beyond. You can see it in the American founders, Franklin, Jefferson. It was steeped in this stuff deeply. Ben Franklin spent years in Europe, right in the thick of the philosophic circles in Paris. He was a conduit bringing these ideas back and adapting them. And Jefferson as a master to France during their revolution, she wasn't just watching, he was actively encouraging them, pushing for a constitution, championing popular sovereignty. Jefferson was seen worldwide as a leading philosopher of this new way of thinking. So the Declaration of Independence is basically Locke. It's heavily, heavily influenced by Locke. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is a direct echo of Locke's life, liberty and property. Jefferson tweaked it slightly, but the core idea of unalienable natural rights, that government exists to protect, pure lock. It really underscores how radical the US was at its founding. A nation built on these Enlightenment principles? Totally. It was seen as a dangerous experiment by the old monarchies of Europe, A threat to their entire system. Much like maybe the Soviet Union or revolutionary Iran were seen in later centuries. It challenged everything. Okay, so we've got the political and social shifts. What about the economy? That changed dramatically too, right? From scarcity to abundance. A massive shift. Before the Americas were widely exploited, wealth in Europe was primarily land. And land is finite. To get richer, you generally had to take land from someone else. Constant conflict over limited resources. A zero sum game. Exactly. And the economic system reflecting that was mercantilism, or the Atlantic system. Colonies existed purely to enrich the mother country. All trade had to flow through England or France or Spain. So French colonial rum had to go to France first, get taxed, maybe then sold to British colonies, and vice versa for British colonial goods. Precisely. It was incredibly inefficient. Inflated prices and deliberately kept the colonies dependent and, well, poor. They weren't citizens, they were resources for the homeland. Mercantilist policies were designed to extract wealth. But then all that gold and silver from the Americas starts flooding Europe, right? Suddenly there's this huge influx of capital, more money than the old systems could really absorb. After building palaces and funding armies, where does the excess go? Increasingly, into technology, into innovation, sparking the Industrial revolution. That's a major factor. Yes. And with industrialization, wealth changes. It's not just land anymore. A factory can produce theoretically unlimited goods. Wealth becomes capital, money generated through production and trade. The limit isn't land, it's ingenuity, effort. The pie suddenly seems infinitely expandable. In theory, yes. And the economic philosophy that arose to match this was laissez faire. Leave it alone. The opposite of mercantilism's tight control completely. The idea popularized by Adam Smith was let individuals pursue their own economic gain, let markets operate freely. This self interest channeled through free markets will benefit everyone. The individual society through more goods and jobs, and the government through taxes. Less government interference is better. So capitalism, that's the third pillar. Alongside democracy and secularism, that's the third essential piece of what we call classical liberalism. Democracy, popular sovereignty, secularism, separation of church and state, toleration and capitalism, free markets, private property, those three together form the core. And we need to be clear, classical liberalism isn't the the same as how liberal is often used in the US today, right? No, it's important to make that distinction. Classical liberalism refers to this Enlightenment foundation, arguably almost anyone in the mainstream US political spectrum who believes in the Constitution, individual rights, democracy, market economy, is a classical liberal in this historical sense. It stands against theocracy, monarchy, authoritarianism. So these three pillars, democracy, secularism, capitalism, this classical liberalism, that's the engine that built the modern world. It really is the driving engine. It set the standard. Even ideologies that react against it are still reacting to it. It became the dominant global framework. Whether nations embraced it, resisted it, or were subjected to it, like through colonialism, which was often driven by these same economic and sometimes civilizing impulses. Okay, so this engine creates the modern world. But there's a twist, right? A challenge inherent in this whole Enlightenment project. There is the Enlightenment gave us this incredibly powerful metanarrative, this grand progress. The idea that things are always getting better. Yes. The belief that through science, technology and education, humanity is on an inevitable upward path towards liberation, perfection, Enlightenment society is constantly improving, moving towards a better future, which was a new idea. People didn't always think like that, not really. Before the Enlightenment, history was often seen as cyclical or static or just divinely ordained. This idea of continuous, linear progress fueled centuries of development. All the inventions, the rising living standards, it seemed to confirm the narrative we were making life better, easier, until the 20th century. And here's the brutal contradiction. How do you square that narrative of inevitable progress with World War I's trenches, the Holocaust, the atomic bomb? These horrors weren't happening despite progress, despite. They were happening in the most scientifically advanced, technologically capable, educated societies the world had ever seen. Rationality and science were used to perpetrate unimaginable brutality. That must have caused a massive crisis of faith in the Enlightenment itself. It did after World War II, especially when many thinkers looked at the devastation and concluded that grand narrative, it's just not true. Science, technology, education, they don't automatically lead to paradise. They can also lead to more efficient killing, more sophisticated oppression. The promise was broken. You can see that shift. Culture. Can't you compare the optimism of, say, Star trek in the 60s? Right. A technological utopia. Humanity united, exploring the stars, spreading democracy. Pure Enlightenment optimism are the dominant themes now. Dystopia, apocalypse, collapse, cynicism. Exactly. Zombie apocalypses, environmental disasters, political thrillers where everyone's corrupt. It reflects a profound loss of faith in that idea of steady, linear progress. We're just not sure we're heading towards that utopia anymore. We're not even sure what progress means. Which leads us to this idea of the postmodern world. What does that mean exactly? Well, it's complex, but one way to think about it is not as a positive thing, but as the absence of something. The absence of that single unifying, overarching story, that Enlightenment metanarrative of progress that everyone buys into. So no grand story to live by anymore. Or rather a fragmentation, lots of smaller stories, competing perspectives, skepticism towards any claim of universal truth or inevitable progress. The big narrative fractured. Okay, so wrapping this up. The Enlightenment's ideas, freedom, reason, science, popular sovereignty, capitalism, they're not just history, they're baked into our world today. Absolutely. They shape our institutions, our debates, our deep seated assumptions about how society should work. We live in a world built on Enlightenment foundations. But here's the final thought, the question maybe to leave you with. The Enlightenment freed us from old constraints, promised this human driven path to perfection. But if we're now living in a postmodern world, where that promise, that grand narrative of progress and singular truth feels broken or naive, what does that mean for us? How do we navigate now? How do we find meaning, make ethical choices, build societies? When the old map, the Enlightenment map towards paradise, seems so tattered and unreliable after the shocks of history, what does progress even look like in a world that's lost faith in the old definition?

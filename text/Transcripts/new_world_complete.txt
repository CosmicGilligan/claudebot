Welcome. Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today we're tearing down some of the conventional wisdom about a moment that truly reshaped our world. We're talking about the pivotal year of 1492. Absolutely pivotal, yeah. And for many of us, you know, it immediately conjures images of Columbus sailing the ocean blue. Right. That's the standard image, definitely. Or maybe a vague memory of that Neil Young song. You know, the one, Cortez the Killer. Ah, yes, dramatic stuff. Dramatic. But as we'll unpack, maybe not the full picture of the conquest of Tenochtitlan. Not quite, no. History's rarely that simple. Exactly. And trust me, there's so much more to this story, especially when you dig into the, well, the underlying currents. Our mission today is really to unpack the real forces at play behind the European encounter with what they called the New World. We want to focus on the surprising economic and social structures that truly shaped early colonization. That's the key, isn't it? The economics? It's about going beyond those simplified narratives and digging into the fascinating, sometimes, well, often brutal realities that determined who benefited, who suffered, and how these societies were just irrevocably changed. That's absolutely right. Understanding the why behind historical events is just crucial. And 1492 is far more than just a date for European exploration. You have to see it as this critical moment for the profound transformation of Spain itself. Right. Spain was changing internally, hugely and simultaneously. It marks the collision of fundamentally different economic systems. Because before European contact, the Americas were home to incredibly diverse and complex societies. Not just one monolithic group, not at all. Many with unique economic structures that profoundly influenced how the Spanish interacted with them later on. So our core question today, I think, is how did these differing economic systems and also the pre existing rivalries between native groups and how did they fundamentally alter the course of colonization and lead to outcomes nobody expected? Exactly. Outcomes that were often unexpected by all parties involved, Europeans and Amerindians alike. The narrative is just so much more nuanced than those simple stories of brave conquerors versus, you know, primitive natives. Okay, let's unpack this pivotal year then. 1492. As you said, for many, it immediately brings Columbus to mind. The default setting. But there was so much more going on in Europe, particularly in Spain, that really set the stage for everything that followed. Historically, before about 1500, Europe was, well, to put it mildly, a bit of a global outlier, wasn't it? You could definitely say that. Less influential than, say, the empires in China or the Ottomans. Right. Its population was pretty stagnant and the culture was in many ways sort of resistant to the kind of rapid change we'd see later. It wasn't the global powerhouse we sometimes project backwards onto it. No. Its fragmented political landsc, constant internal skirmishes, limited access to global trade networks. It meant it was comparatively isolated and maybe poorer than its Eastern counterparts. That's a critical distinction to make. Europe was indeed in a peculiar state, maybe a bit of a backwater in some respects, but it was right on the cusp of a dramatic shift. What kicked that off? Well, what truly acted as a catalytic force for its eventual transformation was, perhaps surprisingly, the rise of the Ottoman Empire. Oh, interesting. How so? Well, this seemingly unrelated event, the expansion of this powerful Islamic empire to Europe's east, had a huge impact. As the Ottomans expanded, particularly into former Eastern Roman Empire territories, Byzantium and all that, many scholars and thinkers fled westward. They carried with them this tremendous influx of classical Greek and Roman knowledge. Stuff that had been maybe lost or less studied in the West. Exactly. And much of which had been preserved and actually built upon by advancements from the Islamic world itself. That knowledge flowed into the fragmented Western European kingdoms. Okay. And this intellectual migration essentially fueled what we now call the Renaissance, literally a rebirth of knowledge. And initially this rebirth was pretty inward looking, wasn't it? I mean, focused on rediscovering ancient texts, lots of theological debates, perfecting art forms. Very much so. And, you know, not entirely unlike the kinds of profound intellectual and theological discussions that had been on going in Muslim societies for centuries already. Right. But here's where it gets really interesting. This Renaissance, combined with the totally unforeseen discovery of the Americas, that mix had a profound and unprecedented impact on Europe's philosophy, its outlook. It really did. It provided a completely new, unexpected source of income for a continent that had, up to this point, been relatively poor and resource constrained. How did that intellectual shift, plus the sudden injection of wealth, truly begin to transform Europe's global standing? That's a fantastic question, because the two were just inextricably linked. The discovery of America wasn't just about finding new lands. It was about tapping into this incredible, previously unimaginable wellspring of wealth. Mostly silver and gold, initially. Primarily silver and gold, yeah. This newfound income was an absolute game changer for Europe's global standing. Philosophically, the Renaissance, with its emphasis on empirical observation, humanism, a renewed interest in exploring the physical world, that laid the intellectual groundwork. Then, when you combine that with the practical challenges and opportunities of overseas exploration, it propelled scientific advancements. Navigation, cartography, shipbuilding. They Needed better tech to get there and back. Precisely. We saw the development of new naval technologies like the agile caravel, later the galleon, military advancements to better cannons, steel armor. Even early industrial technologies started to stir. And this financial infusion, this wealth from the Americas allowed for investments in these areas that frankly the rest of the world simply couldn't match at that point. This created a profound technological and economic advantage that would define global power dynamics for centuries to come. So what does this all mean for Spain specifically? Because 1492 was this year of immense internal transformation for them, which as you said, directly fed into its outward expansion. Absolutely. The most significant event was the culmination of something called the Reconquista. Right, the Reconquest. And this wasn't just a quick battle, it was a centuries long process. Right. Stretching all the way from 711 A.D. all the way back. Yes. Until 1492, it was Christian kingdoms slowly but surely reconquering the Iberian peninsula from Muslim rule from the Moors. And if you look at the maps of Iberia over those centuries, you really see it. The Christian territories start as this tiny sliver in the north and gradually expand, pushing the Moorish control further and further south. It was a long, grinding campaign and the final victory was incredibly symbolic and pivotal. In January of 1492, the Catholic Kings, Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile, we always call the kings. Even though Isabella was Queen regnant. Exactly. They conquered Granada, the last Moorish stronghold on the peninsula. The end of the line for Muslim rule there. It completed the Reconquista. It effectively unified Spain under a fringal hardline Catholic identity. This was a moment of immense national and religious triumph for them, solidifying their power, shaping their national character. But right alongside that victory, in the very same year came another significant and for many a deeply tragic event. Yes, the expulsion of the Jews. This royal decree, issued just months after Granada fell, gave Jewish people in Spain a stark convert to Catholicism or leave the kingdom. A brutal choice. It further solidified Spain as this hardline Catholic kingdom, purging non Christians from its newly unified territories and really cementing the religious homogeneity of the nation. And this religious homogeneity, coupled with Spain's newfound wealth pouring in, had profound implications, not just for Spain, but for all of Europe. Spain's ruler, King Charles I, who was also importantly the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, Right, wore two crowns. Huge territory, huge. He saw himself as the protector of Christendom. His mandate, as he saw it, was to defend and expand Catholicism across Europe, often against the rising tide of Protestantism in the north. The Reformation was kicking off. Exactly. So with the vast resources pouring in from the Americas, primarily silver, by this point, Spain's hardline Catholic identity and the Holy Roman Emperor's role meant that this wealth would be directly funneled into funding these protracted, incredibly expensive wars. Wars against Protestants in northern Europe? Yes, and also against the Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean. So this directly tied the exploitation of the new world to European religious and political conflicts. America became a financial engine for a continent wide struggle for religious and imperial dominance. Wow. Okay, so this intense focus on religious and territorial unity, it also ignited a fresh drive for external ventures, Particularly a new interest in trade. Desperately, Europe wanted Asian goods. Yeah, you know, all the goodies, as some sources put it. Spices, nutmeg, cloves, pepper, cinnamon. So important for food preservation, flavor. Absolutely vital. Plus luxurious silks, precious jewels, advanced technologies like paper, gunpowder. But there was a major problem for Spain. Right. The established trade routes were basically blocked for them. Effectively blocked. Yes. The overland Silk road was largely controlled by powerful intermediaries and Italian city states. Venice, Genoa, they had a lucrative monopoly. Okay. And the existing over water routes around Africa via the Cape of Good Hope, those were meticulously explored and monopolized by their rivals, the Portuguese. So Spain was shut out, pretty much shut out from these lucrative pathways to Asian markets. This raised a crucial question for the Spanish crown, then how could they gain access to these incredibly valuable Asian markets when the traditional routes were closed off? Right. And this desperation for a new trade route led directly to Columbus's, well, seemingly unlikely voyage, because his idea of sailing west to reach China, that wasn't widely accepted, was it? Generally dismissed in Europe is impossible. Most educated people knew the earth was round. That concept goes back to the ancient Greeks. But they drastically underestimated its circumference. They assumed the distance to China via the west would be far, far too great for any ship to carry enough supplies for the journey. Experienced mariners, geographers, they saw it as a fool's errand. But Ferdinand and Isabella. Ah, Ferdinand and Isabella. Fresh off the reconquista, newly unified kingdom and frankly, maybe not much left to lose by taking a gamble. They took a chance on this persistent Genoese sailor. And the outcome. The outcome. As we all know, Columbus sighted land on October 12, 1492. He genuinely believed he'd reached the Indies, you know, the eastern coast of Asia. Hence the term Indians for the indigenous people. Exactly. A lasting misnomer. It wasn't until a few years later that another Italian explorer, Amerigo Vespucci, during his own voyages, recognized that what they had found was truly a novo mundo. A new world, a whole new continent, an entirely new continent, previously unknown to Europeans, which is how America ultimately got its name from Amerigo. But initially, this was a huge disappointment for the Spanish. Right, Huge disappointment. These steamy islands of the Caribbean didn't offer the lucrative trading opportunities of China or the spices of the East Indies. No silks, no pepper. So they pivoted. They pivoted quickly. Instead, they started establishing sugar plantations and other forms of land exploitation, initiating a different kind of colonial enterprise than they had originally envisioned. So the search for Asian luxuries unexpectedly led them to vast new territories with different kinds of wealth to exploit. Precisely. A whole different ball game. Okay, here's where it gets really interesting. I think before the Europeans arrived, the Americas were home to this incredible diversity of societies. Different structures, histories, ways of life. Absolutely not uniform at all. But at a fundamental level, when we look at their economies, we can broadly identify two distinct models. And these models would profoundly dictate their interactions with the Spanish. That's the crucial framework. Yeah. So when you look at the map of Mesoamerica and South America, you see these major civilizations, the Aztec, Mayan, Incan areas, these are what we'll call surplus economies. Right. And then you have vast regions elsewhere where subsistence economies existed, like in Caribbean parts of North America. Lets define those key terms then, because understanding the difference between subsistence and surplus is absolutely crucial to grasping the dynamics of colonization. It really goes back to the very birth of civilization itself. How so? Well, think of it this way. Early human societies were largely nomadic, right? Hunter gatherers, constantly moving to follow their food supply. Okay. But at some point, people developed a stable food supply, usually through agriculture, cultivating corn, beans, potatoes, that sort of thing. Right, the agricultural revolution. Exactly. And this meant they didn't have to move anymore. They could settle in one place, build permanent structures, and eventually that leads to the development of what we call cities. The word civilization itself actually derives from civis, the Latin word for cities. Yeah. So civilization literally means people who live in cities. It's not about being civilized in a moral sense or more advanced than nomads. It just describes a society able to settle down, develop cities, grow beyond just surviving day to day. And that stability allows for more complexity. Precisely. This stable base then allows for what we call stratified societies, societies with different levels of hierarchy, where not everyone has to be a farmer or a hunter. You get specialists, rulers, priests. Got it. This whole phenomenon, the shift from nomadism to City dwelling. It happened much later in the Americas than it did in, say, Mesopotamia, Africa or Asia. But the underlying principle was exactly the same. Stable food leads to cities, leads to hierarchy. So with that in mind, let's dive into the surplus economy in detail. Let's use the Aztec, or as you pointed out, we should probably call them the Mexica as our main example. Their system was fascinating and often misunderstood, wasn't it? Very much so. It was not an empire of direct territorial control in the way we might think of, say, the Roman or Chinese empires, which typically integrated conquered lands directly into their administration. So how'd it work? Instead, the Mexica empire was built almost entirely on tribute. Tribute? That's the critical distinction. The Mexican empire was less about directly governing every inch of conquered land and more about demanding tribute from subject cities and peoples. What kind of tribute? Oh, all sorts. Goods like textiles, valuable feathers, jade, cacao, foodstuffs, but also labor and sometimes even people for sacrifice. Rim very. But if these cities pay their tribute, they were largely left alone. They could govern themselves, worship their own gods, minimal interference from Tenoctitlan, the Mexican capital. And if they didn't pay? Ah, well, if they didn't pay, the Mexican military machine would swiftly conquer them and they'd still end up having to pay tribute anyway, often under much harsher terms. So the Mexica acted more like tax collectors. Extremely forceful tax collectors. That's a great way to put it. Highly efficient and often deeply resented tax collectors. Many subject groups deeply disliked the Mexica, paid under duress, and were constantly looking for opportunities to escape their overlords. This resentment is key. Later on, and you mentioned the name earlier, this point about Aztec versus Mexica, can you quickly clarify that again for us? Seems important. Absolutely. It's a small detail, but it matters for historical accuracy. The name Aztec itself is. Well, it's bit of a historical misnomer. Where did it come from? It actually came from the 19th century German explorer Alexander von Humboldt. In his studies, he based it on their mythical origin in a place called Aztlan. Ah, the mythical homeland. Right. But if you were living in 1519 and walked into Tenochtitlan asking for the Aztecs, everyone would have just looked at you. Funny, they wouldn't know who you meant. Probably not. In 1519, they identified themselves as the Mexica. That's why many historical sources refer to them that way. And why it's generally a more accurate term to use when talking about the people Cortez encountered. It respects their own identity. Fascinating. Good to know. Now, looking at the Mexica social hierarchy, you can immediately see how it operated as this money making machine in terms of extracting wealth. Oh, absolutely. It was structured for it. At the very top was the ruler, the Tlatuani, like Montezuma II at the time of the conquest. And interestingly, you mentioned this position was not hereditary. Correct. Unlike most European kingships, it was an elected position chosen from a specific noble lineage, not automatic father to son succession. Okay. Beneath him, beneath the Tuatawni, were the Pippleton, the nobles. They were often war leaders, high priests, scholars, judges. The ruling class essentially. Got it. Then came the Pachteca. These guys were incredibly powerful, highly specialized, long distance merchants. They weren't just traders. They operated almost like spies, traveling far and wide, bringing back exotic goods, but also valuable intelligence about other regions. Wow. Merchant spies. Pretty much below them were the Maswalten. These were the commoners, craftsmen, artisans, farmers, soldiers. They were typically members of a kalpuli, a sort of neighborhood or clan group, and often held land communally within that group. Okay. The bulk of the population. A large part, yes. And then at the bottom of the free population were the Mayakes. These were peasants, essentially tenant farmers or rural laborers who worked land owned by nobles or the state. They didn't have the same land rights or community ties as the Maswalten. Think of them maybe like day laborers lacking the security of the cal poli members. Right, The Home Depot analogy you used earlier, Something like that, yeah. People working land they didn't own. And then there were slaves. Yes, the Tlacoden slaves. And this is a particularly stark and often misunderstood part of their society. It wasn't quite like European chattel slavery. Well, the Mexica differentiated between slaves who were used for labor, maybe domestic servants or farm workers, and those who were specifically designated for human sacrifice. Also, slavery wasn't necessarily hereditary, and slaves had certain rights. It was complex. But the sacrifice aspect is unavoidable when talking about the Mexica. Absolutely unavoidable. The Nahuar peoples, which includes the Mexica and also the Maya, held this profound, deeply ingrained belief that their gods needed sustenance. Specifically, the sun God Huitilopochtli demanded human hearts and blood to keep the sun moving across the sky and prevent the cosmos from collapsing. So for them, it wasn't just cruelty, it was cosmic necessity. To them, constant sacrifice was not barbaric. It was an absolute necessity for the very continuation of life in the universe. The scale of this practice was frankly staggering. Give us an example. Well, at the dedication of the newly rebuilt temple Omer, the great temple in Tenochtitlan back in 1487, is recorded or estimated. Sources vary that they sacrificed somewhere between 16,000 and perhaps even 20,000 people over just four days. 20,000 people in four days? The numbers are debated, but even the lower estimates are immense. The method was gruesome and highly ritualized. Using a sharp obsidian blade to cut open the chest, rip out the still beating heart, hold it up to the sun, and then the body was often thrown down the temple steps into a pit. And these were mostly often war captives from rival city states. The sheer number highlights the constant warfare needed just to maintain the supply of victims for these rituals. It's a chilling detail, really underscores how fundamentally different their worldview was. Utterly different framework for understanding the world. But okay, bringing it back to the economy. The mechanism, surplus is key here, right? Absolutely key. The bottom groups in that hierarchy, the Maswaltan commoners, the mages, peasants, and the Tullakotan slaves used for labor. They produced enough food and goods for everyone in society to live. They covered the basics. They covered the basics? Yes, the excess, the surplus that was produced beyond basic subsistence needs was then funneled upwards to the Pippelton nobles, the Pakteka merchants, the priests, the Tlatawani. And this freed up the elites. Exactly. It allowed the top tiers of society to be freed from direct production. This enabled them to engage in other pursuits. Warfare, managing the tribute system, developing extensive trade networks, complex governance, creating sophisticated writing systems, and undertaking the grand construction projects like temples and palaces that defined Tenochtitlan. So this constant flow of excess wealth from the producers to the elite, that's why Tenochtitlan truly operated as a money making machine. A vibrant, complex city built on this massive tributary system. Precisely. A complex engine fueled by tribute and surplus labor. Okay, so that's the Mexica. What about the other major surplus economies? The Maya, for example? They weren't a unified empire like the Mexica, were they? No, not at all. The Maya were far more decentralized. It's better to think of them as a broad cultural area comprised of maybe 50 or more distinct, often warring city states. Places like Tikal, Calakmol, Chichen Itza. Right. Famous ruins today. Famous ruins today. They shared a common cultural base, a sophisticated writing system, remarkable calendar system, similar religious beliefs, architectural styles, and related Mayan languages with various dialects. But politically. Politically, they were perpetually disunified, engaged in constant internal conflict, shifting alliances, warfare between city states. The state of fragmentation remarkably persisted right up until the 1800s. In some areas, it stands in stark contrast to the Mexica's tributary empire. And this fragmentation would matter when the Spanish arrived? Absolutely. It meant there was no single ruler to capture, no central power to overthrow. To gain control of the whole region, the Spanish had to conquer them piece by piece, city by city. A much longer process. Okay, then when we look south to the Andes, we find the Inca. How did they compare? Ah, the Inca, they were much closer to what we traditionally think of as a unified, centralized empire. They called it a vast state stretching along the Andes. And their method of control was different, quite different from the Mexica's tribute focused system. When the Inca conquered a people, they often employed a policy called mitma. They would physically relocate large groups of the conquered population closer to the imperial center, maybe near the capital of Cuzco. Moving them wholesale. Yes. And then they'd move other loyal groups into the newly conquered areas. This served to break up local resistance, enforce cultural and linguistic homogeneity. Katua, the Inca language. And integrate the territory more fully into the empire. Wow. Social engineering on a massive scale. It really was. They also had a highly developed road network, the Kapaknin, and a unique system of record keeping using knotted strings called khipu. It was a much more centralized and integrated system than the Mexicas. And the ruler, the Inca ruler, the Zapa Inca, like Apulpa at the time of the Spanish arrival, was seen as a living God, a divine figure, son of the sun God, Inti. His word was absolute law. And this mattered for the conquest too profoundly. It contributed significantly to the relative ease, and I used that term carefully, of the initial Spanish takeover. When Pizarro managed to Capture Atahualpa in 1532. A tiny group of Spaniards capturing an emperor surrounded by his army. Still amazing. An audacious ambush. But because Atahualpa was seen as divine, his orders, even as a captive, were largely obeyed. People continued to follow his commands, which initially meant offering vast ransoms and not mounting widespread, immediate resistance. This bought the Spanish crucial time. It demonstrates the vulnerability of a highly centralized system who focused on a single divine authority figure. Okay, so that's the surplus model and its variations. Mexica, Maya, Inca complex, stratified societies accumulating wealth. Now, let's turn to the other side of the coin. The subsistence economy. Right. The other major economic world the Spanish encountered, particularly in places like the Caribbean islands, Florida, much of North America, parts of South America, away from the Andes and Mesoamerica. How did that work? Well, the subsistence economy is fundamentally characterized, as the name suggests, by a system where everyone works together to produce just enough food and resources for the community to live. It's just enough to get by, Pretty much. There's no significant large scale excess production beyond the immediate needs of the group. Daily needs, seasonal needs, maybe a small reserve, but not vast quantities stored or controlled by an elite. Did they have leaders? Oh, yes. They might have had a cacique or a tribal chieftain, someone who held authority, guided decisions, maybe led in warfare or ceremonies. But these societies were generally much more egalitarian, more democratic in their decision making compared to the empire's Decisions by consensus? Often, yes. Leadership was frequently based on respect, wisdom, influence, rather than rigid hereditary hierarchy or coercive power backed by armies and tribute systems. So the key difference is no surplus is generated, no substantial accumulated surplus. Exactly. This means there's no concentrated wealth left over to support a non producing elite class. No kings, high priests, nobles living off the labor of others. In the same way, you don't see the massive temples, the elaborate palaces, the sprawling urban centers that characterize the surplus economies. But it doesn't mean they were poor necessarily. Not at all. That's a crucial distinction. It doesn't imply they were poor in the sense of lacking resources or well being. Many lived quite comfortably, sustainably, meeting their needs within their environment. It simply means their economic structure didn't generate an excess that could be easily siphoned off or redirected by an external power. Everyone contributed, everyone shared. But no big pot of gold at the top for someone else to grab. Exactly. No centralized treasury or tribute system for an outside force to simply take over. This difference would be fundamental to how the Spanish approached them. Okay, so part three. Let's talk Spanish strategy. If you're a Spaniard arriving in this new world and your main goal is getting rich, which, as we've established, was a primary driver. The main driver for many, yes. How do these two distinct economic systems, subsistence versus surplus, fundamentally influence your approach to colonization? It seems like it would have to. Absolutely. It dictated everything that followed. It boils down to a crucial question. For the conquerors, for the colonizers, where do you find the value? Is the primary value in the land itself, or is it in the people who are already organized to produce wealth? Okay, so two potential sources of value, right? And the Spanish, very quickly, very pragmatically adapted their strategy based on the type of economy they encountered. So let's start with the subsistence economies. Where did they find the value there? For subsistence economies like those they Predominantly found first in the Caribbean islands, Hiscaniola, Cuba. There was no established system of tribute, no large agricultural surplus to easily extract from the people themselves. Right. Everyone was just producing enough for themselves. Exactly. So the value was seen almost entirely in the land. The focus shifted immediately to the raw materials. The potential for mining, though gold, was less abundant than hoped, and especially the agricultural potential of the territory itself. This is precisely why we see the rapid establishment of large scale sugar plantations in the Caribbean. Sugar was incredibly valuable in Europe, a burgeoning commodity. But it required vast amounts of land and crucially, massive amounts of labor. And the tragic fate of the people in these areas seems to reflect that singular focus on land extraction. It does. Tragically, they were swiftly subjugated. If they resisted, they were often killed. If they didn't, they were frequently enslaved to work these new plantations. Exactly. Take the example of the Taino and Carib peoples, the indigenous groups of the Greater and Lesser Antilles, who gave their name to the Caribbean Sea. The Spanish initially tried to enslave them for labor on these burgeoning plantations and in early gold mining efforts, but that didn't work well. It proved disastrously ineffective. Indigenous peoples turned out to be extremely poor slaves for the Spanish for a complex mix of reasons. Their deep ties to their land, their different concepts of work and time, made forced gang labor incredibly difficult. Resistance, escape, and frankly, a lack of agricultural experience suited to large scale monoculture all played a role. But wasn't there something else, something even more devastating? Yes, Overwhelmingly, the most devastating factor was disease. They had absolutely no immunity to European diseases like smallpox, measles, influenza, even the common cold, which the Europeans inadvertently brought with them. Germs they'd never encountered. Never. The complete disappearance of entire populations like the Tainoa on Hispaniola, who numbered perhaps in the hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions at contact, but were virtually extinct within just a few decades. It's just staggering. And this was mostly disease, not necessarily deliberate killing. The vast majority of deaths among native populations, certainly in the early decades, were caused by these Old World diseases, far more than deaths from warfare or direct violence, horrific as those were. So in these subsistence areas, the core Spanish policy became one of displacement and brutal exploitation. Push the natives aside, take the land, import labor if needed, which led to the Atlantic slave trade, and extract value directly from the land itself. It led very quickly to their near total decimation. Okay, now, in stark contrast, what about the surplus economies like the Mexico or the Inca? Different strategy there. Almost the inverse strategy here. The value was clearly seen not just in the land, but primarily in the people, or rather in the existing sophisticated social and economic machinery they had already created for generating wealth. The tribute system organized labor. Exactly. When faced with societies that already had complex stratified structures generating a substantial surplus, the Spanish strategy was generally not to destroy them, but to essentially cut off the top. Meaning, capture or neutralize the existing rulers. Montezuma, Atahualpa. Remove the supreme indigenous leadership, but crucially, keep the lower social strata, the commoners, the local administrators, largely intact, and keep the existing tribute systems operational. Why would that work? Because the commoners, the masaltina maixes in the Mexica system or their equivalents in the inc empire, were already accustomed to being ruled, accustomed to paying tribute. From their perspective, arguably it mattered less whether their overlords were Mexicanobility or Spanish conquerors, as long as the fundamental system for their labor and tribute remained somewhat stable, at least initially. So the Spanish just inserted themselves at the top? Pretty much. The Spanish often left local indigenous nobility, the curacas in the Andes or local lords in Mesoamerica in place. They allowed them to continue governing their communities, provided, of course, that tribute was now paid to the Spanish crown or to individual Spanish conquistadors. What was the main change they imposed then? Besides who got the money? The primary overt change imposed was religious conversion, Replacing indigenous gods and religious practices with Christianity, often forcibly and brutally dismantling temples, destroying idols. This was a standard practice in conquests throughout history, a way of asserting cultural and spiritual dominance. But they weren't trying to dismantle the system of wealth generation itself. Initially, no, they were trying to redirect its output to their own benefit, take over the existing money making machine, not break it. So this means the Spanish intended to maintain these surplus societies, not destroy them. Precisely because these complex societies were the source of pre existing wealth and a ready made labor force. That was the plan. The most efficient way to get rich was to harness the existing system, but something else entirely, something unforeseen, led to their devastating collapse anyway. And that unforeseen consequence was once again the catastrophic impact of old world diseases. Smallpox, measles, typhus. They hit the densely populated cities hard, incredibly hard. Lacking any natural immunity, the indigenous populations of these highly concentrated urbanized surplus economies were decimated. We're talking population losses of 50%, 70%, even 90% or more in many areas within a century. Just unimaginable losses. Unfathomable. And crucially, this wasn't a deliberate Spanish policy of extermination in these regions. It was an unintended biological catastrophe. The social structure of these surplus economies ultimately collapsed. Not because the Spanish initially tried to destroy it, but because the very people who made the money making machine operate, the farmers, the artisans, the laborers, the tribute collectors, the local administrators, were dying in massive numbers. So the engines seized up. Exactly. With the population decimated, the labor force vanished. The sophisticated systems of tribute production, trade and administration simply became inoperable. The Spanish had taken over this vibrant engine, only to watch it grind to a halt as its fuel source. The people disappeared. This brings us to a really crucial point about how we often perceive this history, especially regarding the Black Legend. Ah, yes, the Leanda Negra. There's this common narrative, particularly strong in English speaking countries historically, that portrays the Spanish as uniquely brutal colonizers, deliberately killing all the people, stealing everything, utterly destroying cultures, painting them as exceptionally evil compared to, say, the English or French. And look, let's be clear, the Spanish conquest was undeniably brutal. There was immense violence, suffering, exploitation and death. No question about that, of course. But the Black Legend, as a specific narrative portraying Spanish cruelty as unique or exceptional, was largely propagated by rival European powers, specifically the Protestant English and Dutch and the French during periods of intense, intense imperial and religious rivalry with Catholic Spain. Propaganda, basically. A lot of it was effective propaganda. Yes. Designed to demonize the Spanish, justify piracy against Spanish treasure fleets, and legitimize their own colonial ambitions as somehow more humane or righteous. So what's the crucial nuance we're missing if we just accept the Black Legend? The crucial nuance here is that the reason for the different outcomes we see, the near total destruction and displacement in subsistence areas like the Caribbean versus the initial attempt to maintain and co opt native societies in surplus areas like Mexico and Peru was primarily driven by economic strategy, not necessarily by a fundamentally different level of inherent brutality between the Spanish and other European powers. So it was about the economics they encountered? Largely, yes. When the French and English began their major colonization efforts later in North America, they predominantly encountered societies that were, from their perspective, closer to the subsistence model. Smaller villages, less centralized political structures, no vast tributary empires. This naturally led them to adopt colonial policies focused on displacement, pushing natives off the land to make way for European settlement and agriculture, or engaging in trade for furs rather than incorporating native labor on a massive scale. It looked different from central Mexico, but it was similar in outcome to what the Spanish did in the Caribbean. So the key takeaway is that colonial policy, whether Spanish, English or French, was largely driven by the strategy for extracting value. Exactly. And that Strategy varied dramatically based on the type of native economy and society encountered. That's why understanding the economics is so fundamentally important To a nuanced understanding of this period. Rather than just resorting to simplistic moral judgments, Comparing one European power to another. They were all brutal in their own ways, Driven by their own interests, Adapting to the circumstances they found. Okay, so after the initial shock of the widespread deaths from disease, and realizing they couldn't just extract tribute from a vastly diminished, or in some places, non existent labor force, how did the Spanish adapt their system, Especially in those former surplus areas like Mexico and Peru? They needed a way to formalize control over the remaining labor, right? Yes, they absolutely did. The initial chaos and population collapse Forced them to create a more structured formal system. And this is where the encomienda system comes in. It's a really critical mechanism the Spanish developed and implemented, Particularly in regions like Mexico and Peru, to formalize their control over indigenous labor and tribute after the initial conquest phase. So what was an encomienda, exactly? An encomienda was essentially a grant made by the Spanish crown to a deserving Spaniard, Usually a conquistador, an early settler, or some other prominent figure. This grant gave the Spaniard, the encomendero, the right to demand tribute and, crucially, unpaid labor from a specified number of indigenous people living in a particular area. So it wasn't a grant of land? Not directly, no. That's a common misconception. The grant was technically for control over the people and their labor, not ownership of the land itself. Although in practice, the encomendero often controlled the land that people lived and worked on as well. And what was the justification? What were the encomenderos responsibilities? Well, theoretically, the encomendero was responsible for the welfare of the indigenous people under his charge. This included ensuring they were converted to Christianity, protecting them from enemies, and generally overseeing their well being. But in practice? In practice, as you can imagine, the system was wide open to abuse and often amounted to little more than forced labor and brutal exploitation. The responsibilities were often neglected, While the demands for tribute in goods like maize, textiles, pottery, or later gold and silver from mines, and especially for labor service, were ruthlessly enforced. So it was a way to reward the conquerors and get labor? Exactly. The purpose of the encomienda was, first, to reward the conquistadors for their service to the crown, Giving them a source of income and status in the New World, and second, perhaps more importantly, to maintain a readily available labor force to work in mines, especially the silver mines like Potosi and Zacatecas on agricultural estates, haciendas, or in public works projects like building churches in cities. It was the engine driving the colonial economy. How did they enforce it? Did they use the old structures? Yes, very often. The incomederos would frequently leverage the existing indigenous leadership structures, the local chiefs or headmen, known as caciques in the Caribbean and parts of Mesoamerica or Caracas in the Andes, to organize the labor drafts and collect the tribute from their own communities. So they co opted the local elites. Again, they did. It essentially repurposed the pre existing Amerindian tribute and labor systems, simply redirecting the flow of wealth and manpower from indigenous elites to Spanish ones. It was a clear demonstration of how the Spanish sought to integrate existing structures into their colonial framework for maximum economic benefit. Adapting to the post disease reality. A testament again to their opportunistic and pragmatic approach to building their empire. Okay, that makes the transition clear. Now let's zoom in. Part four, the Conquest of Mexico. We've got the economic backdrop, the strategies. Let's look at one of the most famous, maybe infamous encounters. The Conquest of the Mexican Empire by Hernan Cortez. Right. A story everyone thinks they know. Exactly. Often simplified into, you know, a handful of brave Spaniards valiantly overthrowing this vast savage empire. But the details, as always, are far more complex, far more revealing of the true forces at play. The reality is much messier and much more interesting. So the initial Spanish headquarters in the New World were on Hispaniola, modern Dominican Republic and Haiti. Yes, Santo Domingo was the first major Spanish settlement. From there they launched various explorations. They eventually stumbled upon the Yucatan Peninsular, which they initially thought was just another island like Cuba. Didn't realize it was part of a huge continent at first. And there's that funny story about the name Yucatan. Ha. Yes. The anecdote goes that the Spanish asked the local Maya, what is this place? And the natives, not understanding Spanish, replied something that sounded like Yucatan, which apparently meant, I don't understand you. Or possibly listen to how they talk in their language. And the Spaniards just took it as the name. So the story goes. Whether it's true or not, it highlights the communication barriers. Definitely. And driving these explorations was this relentless search for wealth, fueled partly by the legend of El Dorado, the Golden one. Ah, El Dorado. A powerful myth. It wasn't just a fantasy. It was a deeply motivating force for exploration across the Americas for decades. Where did that legend come from? It seems to have originated from accounts of a muisca Ritual in present day Colombia, where a new chief would cover himself in gold dust and dive into Lake Guatavita. But the Spanish expanded it into a mythical golden city or empire, always just over the horizon. And many of the Spaniards pushing west, were these disappointed Hidalgos? Yes, exactly. Spaniards from the minor nobility, the hidalgo class. They came to the Americas seeking fortune and status, hoping to return home wealthy and respected. But many found the early Caribbean settlements based on steamy plantations, as you put it, deeply unsatisfying. Not glamorous enough. Not glamorous, not quick riches. They had no desire to live out their lives managing agriculture or overseeing indigenous labor on some islands. They wanted gold, silver, instant wealth, the kind that would let them live like true grandees back in Spain. This fueled their relentless quest for gold and the search for El Dorado, pushing them further westward into the unknown interior. And the Spanish conquest structure itself was kind of set up to encourage this, wasn't it? With the charters and rewards it was. The king would grant captains like Diego Velazquez, the governor of Cuba, these capitulationes, basically royal charters or contracts. They authorized the captain to conquer specific lands and establish settlements in the king's name at their own expense, Usually often largely at their own expense. Yes, it was a form of privatized conquest. Once conquered, the land technically belonged to the Crown. But in return, the captain and his men would receive rewards, usually land grants, titles, and often, crucially, these encomiendas, the rights to indigenous labor and tribute. But as you said, for many ambitious Spaniards, just getting an encomienda on an island wasn't the ultimate prize. Not at all. Many were urban people, accustomed to a different life in Spain. They wanted liquid wealth, gold and silver, to return home and live in style, not toil away supervising farming. This widespread disappointment only intensified the drive to find existing wealthy empires ripe for the taking. Which brings us to Hernan Cortez. Indeed. And this leads us to that crucial question that really reshapes the common narrative. How did a relatively small force of Spaniards, maybe 500 to 600 men, initially manage to overthrow such a powerful and populous empire as the Mexica? It seems impossible. On the surface, it does. The key lies not in Spanish numbers or even superior technology alone, Though steel weapons, armor, horses, and cannons helped. The real key lies in strategic alliances and exploiting the deep internal divisions among the Amerindian peoples themselves and Cortes themselves. His expedition wasn't exactly officially sanctioned, was it? Huh? Not even close. Cortez's undertaking was, in fact, criminal from the viewpoint of Spanish law. At the time he was a subordinate of Diego Velasquez, the governor of Cuba, who had initially authorized Cortez to lead an expedition, but then rescinded the order. Why did he distrust Cortez? Velazquez grew wary of Cortez's ambition and likely wanted the potential glory and riches for himself or someone more loyal. But Cortez, already having invest heavily and gathered his men, defied Velazquez's direct orders and departed Cuba anyway in February 1519. So he was an outlaw. Technically, yes. He and his men were rebels against the governor's authority. His only hope was to achieve such a spectacular success, find El Dorado, conquer a rich kingdom, that he could appeal directly to the king, bypass Velasquez and secure forgiveness and rewards. It was an incredibly audacious gamble, high stakes, and a truly crucial figure in all of this. Someone whose role just cannot be overstated. Was La Malinche absolutely essential. Also known as Malinson, later baptized as Dona Marina. Who was she? She was a young Nahua woman, likely from a noble family herself, but had been sold or captured into slavery among Maya speaking people on the coast. She was given to Cortes along with other women by a local chief shortly after he landed. And her linguistic skills were key, extraordinary and utterly pivotal. She knew Nahuatl, the language of the Mexica, and also Mayan dialects common along the coast. She then rapidly learned Spanish. This made her Cortez's indispensable interpreter. His La lingua, his tongue. But she was more than just a translator, right? Oh, far more. La Mullenche's intimate knowledge of the local political landscape, the intricate web of rivalries, alliances, resentments, the customs and beliefs of the various indigenous groups, was absolutely critical to Cortez's strategy. She didn't just translate words, she interpreted cultures, intentions, warnings, opportunities, like a cultural and political advisor. In essence, yes, she could explain the nuances of Mexica power, who their enemies were, what motivated different groups. Without her, Cortez would have been navigating a completely opaque world, utterly blind to the deep seated resentments against the Mexica that he would so effectively exploit. She was his cultural compass and intelligence officer. So Cortez lands at Veracruz, founds a town to establish a legal basis, albeit flimsy, for his actions, independent of Velasquez. A clever legal maneuver, and thanks largely to Llama lynch, he immediately starts learning about the powerful Mexica empire inland. He begins his march towards Tenochtitlan, the capital, and along the way, he encounters the Tlaxcalans. This is the turning point. The Tlaxcalans were a formidable confederation of city states who had fiercely resisted Mexico domination for generations. They were locked in a state of near constant, low level warfare with Tontitlan, the so called flower wars, which were partly about capturing sacrificial victims. So they were bitter enemies of Mexico. Bitter enemies. Initially, though, the Tlaxcalans fought Cortez fiercely when he entered their territory. They saw the Spanish as just another potential threat. But Cortes managed to turn them. Yes. After several intense battles where the Spanish demonstrated their military effectiveness, but also took losses, Cortez, aided significantly by Loma Lynch's diplomatic skills in translation, managed to negotiate a crucial alliance. Why did the Tlaxcalans agree? They saw the Spanish, these strange, powerful newcomers, as a potential tool, a powerful weapon they could finally use to defeat their hated traditional enemy, the Mexica. It wasn't about some unified native resistance against Europeans. It was about seizing an opportunity within the existing framework of indigenous politics to settle old scores and gain advantage. And they even manipulated Cortez. They did. There's a famous incident where the Tlaxcalans apparently manipulated Cortez into attacking the city of Cholula. Cholula had been a Tlaxcalan ally, but had recently switched allegiance to Tenochtitlan. The Tlaxcalans likely saw this as a way to punish Cholula and test Spanish loyalty. The resulting massacre at Cholula further cemented the alliance and sent a brutal message to Montezuma. It shows how complex the local politics were. Incredibly complex and fractured. And Cortes, with La Malinche's guidance, proved adept at navigating and exploiting these divisions. This alliance with Tlaxcala was arguably the single most important factor in the eventual Spanish success. It provided Cortez not just with safe haven and supplies, but with tens of thousands of experienced warriors who knew the land and hated the Mexico. So Cortes and his now vastly expanded army of Spanish soldiers and thousands upon thousands of Tlaxcalan allies marched closer. They entered the Valley of Mexico, Anahot, as it was called. A stunning sight it must have been. And the capital, Tenochtitlan, was truly astonishing. Built in the middle of Lake Texcoco, not on an existing island, right, but constructed by the Mexica themselves, exactly, on artifact artificial islands called chinampas, connected by causeways, a marvel of engineering. The reason for this unique location, according to some accounts, goes back to their early history. Their reputation for being fierce, maybe even brutal, was such that other groups in the valley wouldn't allow Them to settle on the prime land around the lakeshore. So they built their city out in the water. That story about the coat made of the daughter's skin, is that true? It's a story recorded in some chronicles about their early interactions with the city of Kilohakan. Whether it happened exactly like that is debated, but it certainly reflects the terrifying reputation that Mexica cultivated among their neighbors. A reputation for ferocity and fulfilling the demands of their God, Huitilopochtli, no matter the cost. And that reputation definitely contributed to the willingness of groups like Tlaxcala to join the Spanish against them, without a doubt. Okay, so a quick side note. What happened to those lakes? If you visit Mexico City today, it's not surrounded by water, right? It's dry land. The lakes were gradually drained over centuries, starting even in the colonial period. The process was largely completed by American engineers after the Mexican American War in 1847-48, supposedly as a favor to the Mexicans to deal with flooding and sanitation issues. The profound consequence is that modern Mexico City is built almost entirely on a soft, unstable lake bed. It's like building a metropolis on, well, jello. The sediment amplifies seismic waves dramatically, which is why earthquakes are so devastating there. Exactly. Tremors that might be minor elsewhere can be catastrophic in Mexico City because the ground itself shakes so violently. A direct legacy of its unique origins and later engineering decisions. Fascinating. Okay, back to 1519. As Cortez approached Tenochtitlan, Montezuma, the Tlatuani initially tried to stop him, didn't he? He did. He sent emissaries with lavish gifts. Gold, jewels, intricate featherwork, hoping to impress Cortez, but also with explicit orders for the Spaniards to turn back, not to come to the capital. But the gifts had the opposite effect completely. The sight of so much gold only fueled Cortez's determination and avarice and convinced him he'd found the rich empire he was seeking. He politely ignored the request to leave. So the historic meeting between Cortez and Montezuma finally occurred on one of the causeways leading into Tenochtitlan in November 1519. A truly momentous occasion, dramatically recounted in the historical sources. And here's where we hit that interesting discrepancy you mentioned earlier. Right between the sources. Yes. It's a fascinating example for anyone doing a deep dive when you compare the accounts. A key native source compiled decades later by Fray Bernardino de Sagun, working with indigenous informants, the Florentine codex, records Montezuma saying something profound to Cortes. Words to the effect of, oh, our Lord, you have come to arrive on Earth. You have come to govern your city of Mexico. Wow. Sounds like surrender. Or recognizing Cortez as a returning God. Quetzalcold, maybe. It's often interpreted that way, loaded with prophetic meaning. But crucially, the Spanish chronicler Bernal Diaz del Castillo, who was an eyewitness right there with Cortes, doesn't mention that specific crucial line at all in his extremely detailed account of the meeting. Describes mutual greetings and gifts, but not that statement of submission. So what does that tell us? It immediately forces us to think critically. Was the native account recorded later shaped by the outcome, trying to explain the inexplicable defeat? Was Montezuma hedging his bets, using ambiguous language? Did Diaz simply omit it or not understand its significance? It highlights how historical narratives are constructed, the perspectives they represent, and what different groups chose to record, emphasize, or perhaps invent after the fact. You can't just take one source at face value. A great reminder. Okay, so despite Montezuma's initial attempts to dissuade him, and maybe that possibly prophetic greeting, Cortez and his small Spanish army, with their thousands of Tlaxcalan allies waiting, camped outside the city for the time being, were invited into the heart of Tenochtitlan, a seemingly peaceful entry. But Cortez was wary. And his immediate act, his immediate and incredibly audacious act within days of being welcomed as guests into the palace, was to seize Montezuma and place him under house arrest. Just like that. Captured the emperor in his own palace. Just like that. Cortez feared being trapped, surrounded by hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of Mexico warriors in their vast, unfamiliar city. He believed holding their divine Platuani hostage was his only leverage, his only way to control the situation and ensure his own safety. Montezuma became effectively a captive puppet ruler. But the Spanish hold on the city was precarious, right? It didn't last smoothly. Not at all. While Cortes was consolidating his control through Montezuma, word reached him that the governor of Cuba, Diego Velazquez, hadn't forgotten about his insubordination. Ah, the rival Spaniards. Exactly. Velazquez had sent a much larger Spanish army, led by Panfilo de Narvaez, to Veracruz with orders to arrest Cortez and take over the expedition. So Cortes had to leave Tenoctitlan. He had to. Leaving a garrison behind under the command of one of his captains, Pedro de Alvarado, Cortez marched back to the coast with some of his men to confront Narvaez. And he won. Even though he was outnumbered? He did. Not through a straightforward battle, but through a combination of clever tactics. A surprise night attack, and, crucially, by persuading many of Narvaez's own men, tempted by the promise of Tenochtitlan's riches, to abandon their commander and join Cortez. His charisma and the lure of gold were powerful tools. He returned towards Tenochtitlan with significantly bolstered Spanish forces. But while he was away, things went wrong in the capital. Disastrously wrong. Yeah. The man Cortez left in charge, Pedro de Alvarado, proved impulsive and, well, maybe not the most culturally sensitive commander. Some sources call him a bonehead in this instance. What did you. During a major religious festival, feast of tox cattle, Alvarado apparently feared an uprising. Maybe he misinterpreted the ceremonial dances and gatherings. He ordered his men to attack the unarmed Mexican nobility and priests who were celebrating in the main temple courtyard. It was a horrific massacre. That sounds like the breaking point. It was absolutely the straw that broke the camel's back. A profound insult. An act of horrific sacrilege during one of their most sacred rituals. It turned the entire Mexican population, who had previously been tense but somewhat tolerant of the Spanish presence under Montezuma's orders, violently against them. The city erupted, so the Spanish were trapped. Trapped and besieged in their palace. When Cortes returned, he walked into a city in full rebellion. They were forced to attempt a desperate nighttime escape from Tenochtitlan on June 30, 1520. This became known as La Noche Triste. The sad night. The sad night. They tried to sneak out over the causeways burdened with gold, but they were discovered. The Mexica attacked fiercely from canoes and on the causeways. Hundreds of Spaniards, perhaps more than half, and thousands of their Slaxcalan allies were killed or drowned, weighed down by the very treasure they were trying to carry away. It was a devastating defeat for Cortez and Montezuma. What happened to him? Montezuma had been killed shortly before or during Lo Noche Triste. How exactly remains uncertain. The Spanish accounts claim he was killed by stones thrown by his own people when Alvarado forced him onto the palace roof to try and calm the crowds who now saw him as a traitor. Indigenous accounts sometimes suggest the Spanish killed him themselves before they fled, perhaps stabbing him. Nobody knows for sure who delivered the final blow. So after La Noche Triste, the Mexica had a new leader. Yes, a new emperor. Guatemoc, a fierce warrior And Montezuma's nephew took the throne. He was determined to resist. He rallied the Mexican forces and prepared for the inevitable Spanish return, leading the defense of the city in a prolonged and incredibly fierce war against the Spanish and their now even more numerous n allies. So Cortez didn't give up. Not Cortez. After being driven out, the Spanish retreated to the safety of Blaxcala to regroup, lick their wounds, and plan their counterattack. This took months. And what was their plan for taking the city? This time it was on a lake hard to assault. They realized they needed naval power. In an incredible feat of logistics and determination, Cortez ordered the construction of 13 small warships, brigantines, in Pluxalt. Then they dismantled the ships, carried them piece by piece over the mountains to Lake Texcoco, and reassembled them on the lake shore. Wow. Build ships inland and carry them over mountains. An amazing feat. These ships, armed with cannons, allowed the Spanish to control the lake, blockade the city's vital supply lines coming in via canoe, and support their ground assaults along the causeways. So they laid siege, a brutal siege lasting months. They systematically bombarded Tenochtitlan from the ships and land. They cut off food and fresh water. They fought their way slowly down the causeways and then engaged in horrific house to house, street by street, fighting within the city itself. Smallpox also raged through the besieged population, killing thousands and weakening the defenders further. And the final stand. The final brutal conquest culminated in Cuautimoc's last stand in the northern part of the city, Klatelock, which had its own major marketplace and temple complex. He was captured on August 13, 1521. That effectively marked the fall of the Aztec, or rather Mexican empire and the beginning of three centuries of Spanish rule in central Mexico. So the crucial takeaway here, the thing that really reframes the whole story, the crucial takeaway which completely reshapes our understanding of this conquest, is that it was not just 600 Spanish soldiers and sailors against millions, as the popular narrative often suggests. It was. It was those Spaniards, plus, crucially, tens of thousands of Indian allies, maybe even hundreds of thousands over the course of the siege, primarily the Tlexcalans, but also warriors from other groups like the Totonacs and Texcocans who resented Mexican domination. So the question becomes, why did these native allies side so decisively with the Spanish? The answer is brutally simple and deeply rooted in the Mexico's own imperial system. The Mexica were incredibly effective, but also incredibly brutal and widely resented overlords. The tribute, the sacrifices Exactly. Groups like the Tlaxcalans, who had suffered under Mexica tribute demands, constant warfare, and the perpetual threat of having their people captured for sacrifice for generations. They saw the Spanish not as liberators in some abstract sense, but as one powerful group among many. A tactical ally, a weapon they could use to finally defeat their traditional rival. So they weren't thinking natives versus Europeans, not in the way we might. They saw it as Tlaxcalans and Spanish allies versus their hated enemy, the Mexica. It was an opportunity within their own political world to settle old scores, overthrow an oppressive empire, and potentially gain power and autonomy for themselves. They couldn't have foreseen the long term consequences of Spanish colonialism, of course. So this internal division, these pre existing hatreds, this strategic opportunism, that's what made the conquest feel feasible. It made it far more feasible than it would have been otherwise. The Spanish didn't conquer the Mexica alone. They did it by expertly leveraging the Mexica's own enemies against them. It was as much an indigenous civil war catalyzed and led by the Spanish as it was a purely foreign conquest. That complexity is key. Wow. Okay. We've navigated these complex economic landscapes, the intense, often brutal alliances and strategies that define these earliest moments of colonization in the Americas. It's definitely a far cry from the simplified stories we often hear. It really is far from brave conquerors versus primitive natives or even uniquely evil Spaniards versus innocent victims. The reality was this messy, brutal collision of cultures driven by European ambition for wealth. Yes, but absolutely facilitated by indigenous political rivalries. And those pre existing economic structures we talked about, structures that made certain societies vulnerable to conquest and exploitation in specific ways. So if we connect this back to the bigger picture. If we connect this to the bigger picture, it really highlights how these underlying economic structures, surplus versus subsistence, combined with existing political rivalries, dictated the fate of empires and peoples in ways that were often unforeseen by any of the actors involved at the time. Right. Nobody planned for the diseases, for instance. Nobody planned for the diseases that would decimate populations and shatter the very systems the Spanish initially hoped to exploit. So it wasn't just about military might or deliberate strategy. It was a masterclass in opportunistic redirection of existing wealth systems, followed by adaptation when unforeseen factors like disease blew everything up. So the rise and fall of these empires then becomes less about simple moral judgments and more about understanding this complex interplay of human agency, economic realities, political fragmentation, and those devastating unforeseen biological factors, it forces a more nuanced perspective. So what does this all mean for us thinking about it today, understanding these forces at play? Well, I think it invites us to think critically. Critically about how power, resources and pre existing societal structures, whether economic, political or social, combine to shape historical outcomes. And maybe more importantly, to question the narratives we're often given the simple stories. It makes you wonder, doesn't it, what invisible economic vulnerabilities or maybe internal rivalries we might be overlooking in our own world today. Just as the Mexica might have tragically overlooked the true danger posed by their own tributary systems. Unpopularity when Cortez arrived. That's a really insightful parallel. The Spanish sought a new world of wealth and they found it. Though maybe not exactly the Asian trade they first envisioned, but the methods they used and the consequences that followed were just inextricably tied to the economic and political realities they encountered on the ground. What does it tell us about the nature of power and wealth itself? That even these incredibly formidable empires like the Mexica or the Inca, could be dismantled not just by military might, but by unseen forces like disease, or by turning their own internal rivalries against them. It's a powerful lesson, isn't it? A lesson in historical contingency, the limits of power, and the profound, often devastating unintended consequences of human action. It really makes you wonder what subtle shifts in power or resource distribution, or maybe even unseen biological factors are happening right now beneath the surface of our current events, quietly shaping a future we can barely imagine. Absolutely. We didn't even really get into the long term evolution of systems like the Encomienda today. How it changed over time, the debates it sparked back in Spain, that's a whole other deep dive. Another deep dive for another time. Definitely. Yeah. But it all flows from these initial encounters and the economic strategies forged in those first chaotic decades. A fascinating and sobering look at how one world encountered another. Thanks for unpacking that with us. My pleasure. It's crucial history to understand.

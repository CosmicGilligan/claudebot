Do you guys like my song? Was that the Beach Boys? It sounded like a. No, that was the Beatles. Okay. Yeah, the Beach Boys never sing anything like that. I don't think. Yeah, no, I don't think so. But it's just like the little. I don't know, like how. Yeah, I guess the style. Yeah, It's. It's late 60s. So does anybody want to guess why I played that song today? On the screen it says revolution and the Communist State. So. Yeah, what. What was the name of the song? What was it? Back in the What? In the U.S.S.R. right. So we're getting ready to figure out how we make the USSR you guys know what the. You. You guys know what the USSR Is, right? Or was. Yes. Yes. It was the communist state in Russia from about 1924 until about 1990 or so right around there. Okay, so any questions or comments about anything? I wanted to make sure that you guys knew that I stop shared. I actually screwed up when I made the syllabus and I didn't put Thanksgiving in there. So we're just gonna have to meet next week. I'm just kidding. Do you guys get all freaked out? I'm not gonna meet next week. That was good. So I. I fixed the syllabus. We'll Have Thanksgiving. We're going to do the Russian Revolution today, the Finnish World War I on Thursday, and then we'll be off next week. And look, it's almost over, so. So I don't know if you're looking forward to that or not, but that's where we are anyway. Questions? Comments about anything that I can help you with? No, you guys are good. All right, so let's go back to our slide here. And so somebody fill me in. Remind me what we were talking about at the end of the last lecture. I remember we were talking about a stalemate. No man is land. Okay, so. So anybody, can you remember Powers? Right. Can. Can you remember about what year we were talking about at that time? What was the big topic? We were talking about World War I. World War I. World War I. Okay. 14ish. No. Or 19. Sorry. It started. It started in 1914, but we talked about basically the first half of the war. Right. And what happened in the beginning of the war? Basically, it was a big fiasco, and they ended up in a stalemate that lasted essentially four years. Right. And so when we stopped the things that we could say, okay, well, the United States wasn't involved because the Germans had stopped unrestricted submarine warfare. The French and the British were in a stalemate with the Germans on the Western Front. The Russians were actually losing the war to the Germans and the Austrians on the Eastern Front. The Ottoman Empire and Japan had joined the war. The Ottoman Empire on the side of the Central Powers and Japan on the side of the British. Okay. And we'll remember that Japan joined because they wanted the German colonies in the Pacific. The Ottoman Empire joined because that Russia was their traditional enemy. So. So that's where we left it right there. That was about 1916. And we said that some things were going to happen in 1917 that were going to change the kind of the situation, I guess you could say, in Europe. Before I go on, I want to just ask one question. I told you that Woodrow Wilson was President of the United States and he was reluctant to get the United States involved in the war. Does anybody remember why? It was because of the American signing. Forgot exactly what the name of it was, but it was so that they didn't get involved with European powers. Yeah. Okay. Well, the United states was traditionally isolation, 8 life isolationist, but Wilson was a great proponent of American mission. He thought the American mission was to spread democracy. So having said that, what would keep him from wanting to get involved in the European war at this point, besides Russia being a monarchy? Right. Russia was a monarchy. All right, so we just want to keep that in mind as we go into this. Any questions or comments before we start? So we're going to go back into the middle of the 19th century and we're going to start looking at Russia. And Russia was behind the great Western powers. Germany really wasn't even a country at this point. The Austrian Empire was still very powerful. The British and the French were concerned about upholding, keeping intact the Ottoman Empire. Remember, we said that by this time, the Ottoman Empire was called the sick man of Europe. Okay. And what happened was there was a dispute over who was going to protect the holy sites in the Middle east, which were all in the Ottoman Empire. And eventually it led to a threat by the Russians to invade the Ottoman Empire or to go to war against the Ottoman Empire. And keep in mind that the Russians were, they may or may not have been that interested in defending the holy sites, but they were very interested in advancing into the Balkans. This area here, southeastern Europe. Okay. And so they were putting a lot of pressure on the Ottoman Empire to try to pick up the pieces of that that they wouldn't be able to hold on to. And the reason why they were. The Ottomans were having a hard time holding on to these pieces was because of nationalism. All these little different groups in southeastern Europe were claiming the right to self. Self determination. And so they were breaking away from the Ottoman Empire, and the Russians were trying to take advantage of that. So what happens then is Russia goes to war against the Ottoman Empire, but then the French and the British break in, intervene, and they land in the Crimea and they defeat the Russians in the Crimean War. And what that does is it demonstrates to Russia that it is as much behind as the Ottoman Empire that they have failed to modernize. And we remember what was the. The challenge of the 19th century, which was what was it? Modernize or decolonized. Right. Modernize or decolonize. So Russia realized, the czar of Russia, this guy here, Alexander ii, realized that Russia had to. Professor, we're not. We're not seeing your screen. Oh, Jesus, I hate when I did. We thought you were just going on or prepping us, but now we realize we're supposed to be seeing things. See, I had shown it, but then I. I turned it off and I forgot to turn it back on again. Now can you see it? Yes. Okay, so now you can see these handsome gentlemen down here. This was the emperor, Alexander ii. He became emperor right as the Russians were losing the Crimean War. By the way, I don't know if you guys ever heard of this? But there was a famous poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson called Charge of the Light Brigade. Half a league, half league onward into the valley of Death rode the 600. That was the Crimean War. But any rate, the point here is that Russia realizes that it has to modernize. And so this czar, Alexander ii, introduces liberal reforms to Russia with the idea that Russia would become modernized, it would become modernized politically. And then they also entered on a course of forced industrialization, much like Japan did. But they're not going to have the same kind of success that Japan had because they didn't have that kind of control over the country. Well, they weren't really even as advanced industrially as the Japanese were, as we'll see here in a few minutes. Right. Okay. So Alexander II was very popular because he introduced all these liberal reforms, like freeing the Serbs and introducing some elements of democracy. But he was assassinated in 1881. And as a result of that, his. I think it was his brother. I'm not sure it was either his brother or his son. It must have been his son, I guess. Alexander III comes to the throne and he says, well, look what happens when you liberalize. You end up getting shot. So he cracks down on the reforms, really, and tries to double down on the forced industrialization, which creates kind of a powder keg, because now we see all these areas of Russia where workers are going to work in factories, and we see some of the same kinds of despair, I guess you could say, harsh conditions that accompanied modernization everywhere. And so the workers. By this time, there was a history of worker rebellion, worker revolt. This is where the idea of communism came from. So this forced industrialization, along with the crackdown on liberal reforms, is going to cause a lot of social unrest in the. In the Soviet Union. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Alexander III dies in 1894, and his son Nicholas, who becomes Nicholas II, will be the last of the Russian czars. Okay. What? Well, okay, we'll just leave it at that. Any questions or comments about this? Okay, so let's go back then. How do we do this? All right. And so Nicholas continues the repressive policies of Alexander iii. One thing that we need to understand. Well, let's. Let's go on first before I do that. Okay, so. So Nicholas continues. And then in. In the meantime, there is a war in East Asia between the Russians and the Japanese. Okay. It's called the Russo Japanese War, obviously. And the war was over the carving up of the East Asia, essentially part of the carving up of China. What the Japanese wanted to dominate both Korea and Manchuria. The Russians wanted to dominate Manchuria. And there was some back and forth between the Russians and the Japanese. And eventually the Japanese declared war on Russia. And interestingly, the way that they did it was that they attacked. They did a surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur, which is in Manchuria on a Sunday morning. Does that remind you of anything? Pearl Harbor. Pearl harbor, right. So Pearl harbor wasn't unprecedented. But any rate, what happens then is to everyone's shock. And you guys probably saw this in the movie when you, when you did the Japanese, the movie about Japan, right? That to everyone's shock, the Japanese actually won the Russo Japanese War. It was, it was negotiated. The end of it was negotiated by Theodore Roosevelt. He got the Nobel Peace Prize for that. But Russia was. Was humiliated, right? It was not only humiliated in terms of it not being a great power, like, like the other Western powers, like Britain and France and by now Germany. Right. But also the people of, of Russia were humiliated. They were very unhappy about this. Right. And again, there was all of this turmoil over worker conditions. And after the Russian, after the Russo Japanese War was over, there was an incident in St. Petersburg. I don't have a map. I wish I did. I don't think I have a map of Russia. But St. Petersburg is on the Baltic Sea. It's very, it's up by Finland, close to, you know, Sweden and Norway and up in there. Right. So anyway, St. Petersburg, it was. There was an incident there where there was a peaceful demonstration led by an Orthodox priest. And their idea was to present the Czar with a petition to. For him to make it possible for them to have better working conditions and that sort of thing. The, the, the, the Tsar wasn't in Winter palace, which was in Saint Petersburg. He was in the countryside. Right. And the Imperial Guard at. Oh, this is what I wanted to tell you. The reason, the reason, the kind of idea behind this was that many people in Russia, probably most people in Russia at this time, thought of the Czar as their friend, as like their protector, right? And so the idea was, well, if we just let the Czar know how we're being mistreated, he'll stop it. Right. And I don't know if you guys are interested in US History or not. That was the same sentiment that many people in the United States had or in the British colonies in North America had toward King George until he sent a fleet. Right? So what happens here is that these people believe that the Czar once they know what their plight is, he will come to their aid. He's not even in town. And the Imperial Guard fires on the demonstration, killing somewhere between 300 and maybe 3,000 people. Nobody really knows how many people were killed. This is actually a artistic demonstration of what had happened. Imperial troops and the people dying. And the result of that was the Revolution of 1905, where the people of Russia, all throughout Russia rose, were basically had demonstrations, violent riots, all in opposition to what had happened on Bloody Sunday. That's what they call this episode, Bloody Sunday. But what it really shows is that the kind of faith that the people had in the monarchy is broken. People no longer are, I should say it the other way around. People are willing to question the illegitimacy of the monarchy if the monarchy won't protect them, okay? And that's going to. Then it's going to continue this political social tension in Russia from then on. Okay? The way that The Revolution of 1905 ends is with the October Manifesto, which is the establishment of a congress, so to speak, a legislative body, a multi party system, although a lot of parties were actually left out, and a new constitution which was essentially routinely ignored by the Czar. But what happened was that the people believed they had won and so they backed down on their demonstrations. And then the czar basically reneged on everything he promised, essentially. Right, guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? All right, so now a couple other things we need to get into here. The first thing is, and I already kind of talked about this, we remember we said that the Russians wanted, were interested in making gains in southeastern Europe, in the Balkans at the expense of Turkey. The thing that we need to really understand about that is first of all, yeah, they were interested in these gains, but the main thing that they were interested in was this waterway. It's called the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. And the Bosphorus is here and Dardanelles here. And this is the gateway to the ports in Crimea, which is really the only warm water port that Russia has. They have ports in the Baltic Sea, which is way up north, but they're closed in the winter. They have a port in Vladivostok which is on the west, but it's also closed in winter. So the only warm water port to have is in Crimea. And the only way to get there is through this very narrow waterway which is controlled by the Ottomans, who are their enemies. So the Russians are really concerned about advancing into and taking advantage of the Ottoman Empire with, with the ultimate Goal of being able to control this waterway. All right? Now one of the ways that they do that is they, they promote an idea called Pan Slavism. And Pan Slavism essentially is all the Slavic peoples will, will be together in one nation. It's really similar to what, what Hitler, the German nation. All the German nations will be together in one Reich. Right? But here the Russians are doing it and they're saying, well, these people here are all Slavic people and we're Slavic people too. So we should all be one part of, we all should be part of one. One country, one nation. All right? And then also at around the same time, the Russians and the French will sign an alliance. We talked about this last week where the French were afraid of Germany and the Russians were afraid of Austria Hungary. And since Germany and Austria Hungary were allied, the French and the Russians joined an alliance which would cause the Germans, if they fought a war, to have to fight a two front war. So that's what's behind that. And then we need to talk a little bit about communist ideology. All right, so we talked about, when we talked about Marxism, we talked about the Communist Manifesto. And Marx's idea was that there was going to be a spontaneous revolution of the proletariat which would overthrow the capitalist regime and redistribute all property to be held in common, and then the government would disappear. What I want to ask you guys, and I remember I pointed this out, I emphasized this when I talked about the Communist Manifesto. I said, when is the Russian. Sorry, not the Russian. When is this revolution of the proletariat supposed to happen? It was supposed to happen already. It was supposed to happen now. It's happening right now. And where is it supposed to happen? Everywhere. Everywhere. And, and when did it actually happen? Never. Never. And where did it happen? Nowhere. Nowhere. Right. So that's a problem with Marx's ideology. Right. And Lenin realizes this. He also realizes that the conditions that Marx was writing about in 1848 really don't exist in Russia in the beginning of the 20th century because Russia has some industry, but it's still mainly an agricultural country. Right? So the proletariat then is very small. It's not like the proletariat in say Germany or England or France. Right. And so what he comes up with is this idea that Marx was short sighted in expecting this revolution to be spontaneous. Remember, the idea was that the proletariat would eventually grow big enough and unhappy enough that it would just rise up spontaneously and overthrow the capitalist state. Okay? The problem was that in the time since communism had become a popular idea among some people, capitalism had reformed itself in such a way using, for example, some reforms in government that regulated industry and labor unions and things like that, so that the workers in the big capitalist states like Germany and France and England and the United States were relatively happy. They're not really happy, not really that well treated, but they're not unhappy to the point that they're willing to rise up in rebellion. Marx realizes this. Sorry, sorry, Lenin, Lenin realizes this and he says, well, what's happened is that the workers have been mollified by the capitalists into believing that they're well off when they're not well off. And so they need to be led, somebody has to educate them and into realizing that they're being screwed essentially. Right? And so he comes up with this idea of the vanguard, the vanguard of the revolution. Is this going to be this class of intelligentsia who go out to convince the workers that they're being mistreated so that they will be aroused and rise up in revolution. All right? And so that's going to be his, his contribution to Marxist thought. What really, what really the consequence of that is that, if you guys will remember, I showed you a kind of a three, a three segment timeline where there was the feudal system and in the manufacturing system and then communism with the final conflict. Right? The, the Marxist, I guess orthodoxy said that that was how it had to happen. Because remember that Marx said it was scientific, right? Marx said this was, was, was the demonstration of a scientific formula. Okay? And so many people believed that in order for the communist revolution to happen, a country had to go through a stage of liberal capitalism, right? Liberal industrialization. And that's not something that had happened in Russia. Russia was kind of starting on that road, but they're not there. Right? And so many people who were communists believed that in order to achieve communism you had to allow for the creation of a liberal state. And then eventually that liberal state would create enough suffering, I guess you could say, to cause the proletariat to rise up and overthrow it. And that's the scientific formula for how Marxism is comes about. Okay, you guys are with me. And Lenin says, no, that's not. You don't need to worry about that. You don't need to go from an agrarian state to a liberal state to a communist state. You can go straight from an agrarian state to a communist state. Okay? And so what this does is it creates a dividend in international communism, but particularly international communism, or I should say it, this Way, particularly communism in Russia. And so the Russian Communists are going to divide themselves into two different groups, all right? The one group is going to be called the Mensheviks, and the other group is going to be called the Bolsheviks. All right? The Mensheviks means the minority and the Bolsheviks means the majority, which is exactly the opposite of who was in the. Who believed in what idea. Right? Because the Mensheviks, the ones who believe that Marx's formula had to play out, were actually in the majority and the Bolsheviks were in the minority, but they call themselves the minority. Anyway, the point here is that this is a divide then between the Communists in Russia. Okay, do you guys get that? Do you guys understand what I'm saying here? That, that the Communists in Russia are divided into two different groups. The, the Mensheviks are, Are committed to Marx's scientific ideology that says that we have to go. Russia, if it has a revolution, has to become a liberal state first, and then it will become communist. And Lenin says, forget about the liberal state. We go straight from an agricultural state to communism. So they're just. So the Mensheviks are waiting while Lenin and the Bolsheviks want to push it forward? Well, we're going to see how it works out in just a minute. Right, but the idea here is that the Mensheviks are more willing to. Wait. You're, like you say, after the, after the Tsar is overthrown, then Lenin is. Okay, you guys are with me. So, so just keep that in mind for now. The Mensheviks were very, like, they could negotiate and like, come compromise, but Lenin formed the Bolsheviks and wouldn't compromise with the Mensheviks. He just wanted total control over the state, so ended up. Well, it's. That's kind of. That's kind of simplistic. There was a. I mean, yeah, you're in, in kind of the bigger terms. Yeah, you're right. But, you know, he, he went through periods where he was willing to compromise, but it was a complicated process. This, this, he's very stubborn. Evolution of my. Of, of. Of communist thought. Okay. If you ever want, if you, like, have trouble going to sleep at night, go to marxist.org and you can find thousands and thousands of documents on there that are written by people like Lenin and Trotsky and Stalin and others that try to convince you that Marx was right, even though he was wrong. And it's all almost unreadable. So it's almost like reading postmodern academics. Sorry. Okay, so all Right. So anyway, so now Russia joins the war, as we've already talked about. We saw that on last Thursday. And once the Ottomans joined the war, that. Well, first off, the Russian army was no match for the German army, Right? And when it says that the Austrian. Austrian army was making progress against the German, against the Russians, it was only making that progress because the Germans were fighting it for them. Right. But the German army was a professional army with a professional leadership cast. And the Russian army basically was a medieval army with the princes and nobles in charge of the troops who had no training militarily. So the Russians, even though they had a lot of people, were not capable. They were really no match for the Germans. All right? And then once the Ottoman Empire joined the war, their access to the world through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles was cut off. And at the same time, there were bad crops in Russia and fewer people to actually farm because the people were all at the front. And so what happens is that the people are running out of food and the people are downcast, the troops and everyone else is downcast because they know that they're losing the war. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. Okay, so that was war and revolution. Now we're going to talk about revolution and war. All right, so there actually were really two revolutions in Russia in 1917. And so the two revolutions might be called the February Revolution and the October Revolution, or they might be called the March Revolution and the November Revolution. And the reason why is because the Russian Empire was on a different calendar than the West, Right? So when, you know, the Russian submarine commander with a Scottish accent stole the submarine, Red October, it really should have been Red November, but it wasn't. It was Red October. Anyways, just so you know that. At any rate, the point here is the first revolution happens in March with basically the military saying, we're not going to support the war anymore, and the people are all in the streets and the workers have stopped working. And so it becomes obvious to the czar that he's not going to be able to mollify the people. And so he abdicates the throne. Abdicates means I give up, okay? And. And his brother Michael was asked, was offered the throne, and he refused it. So what happened was there was a congress of socialist parties that included the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks. And the Mensheviks were able to prevail and create a provisional government that was led by this guy here, Alexander Kerensky, who looks a lot Like a criminal. But he wasn't really a criminal. He was actually a drug addict. And he's got a haircut like Herman Munster. But anyway, what happens is that from February or March until October, November, Russia is a republic. Okay? So now how is that going to affect Mr. Wilson? Who is Mr. Wilson? If it's a republic, then he'll think about, you know, helping. Right? Because then it would be. Then it would be a war between democracies and monarchies. Right? And his idea is that democracy is going to prevail all over the world. Right? Okay. So when I said Mr. Wilson, I don't mean Dennis the Menace's neighbor, right? I mean the President of the United States. Okay? Now, in July there, even though they have a provisional government that people aren't happy because they're not getting fed, they're still fighting a war. And there's a lot of upheaval in the countryside over who gets to farm what land. And so there are a series of demonstrations that happen in July when Lenin. Lenin is actually in exile in Switzerland by this time. But he hears about what's happening in Russia, and he arranges with the German monarchy for permission to cross Germany and enter into Russia and what they call a sealed train. Right, Sealed train. Essentially, the. The real idea behind a sealed train is that people are in the train. They're not allowed to get off the train in that country, but they're allowed to cross. Okay? And you can imagine why the Germans wanted this, because the Germans are hoping by now that if they can knock Russia out of the war, then they will be able to concentrate their efforts in the Western Front and defeat the Allies. Okay? So they allow it to happen. And then Lenin actually goes into St. Petersburg in Russia and essentially pronounces, okay, we're taking over. Right. And he gets backing from the military. The Mensheviks essentially back down. They don't really back down. What they do is they refuse to participate in the congress that's calling for this new revolution. The result is that the Bolsheviks are able to control the congress as a result of that. Was. Is basically the coup that happens with what they call the Bolshevik Revolution. Okay, so the Bolshevik Revolution really wasn't like a violent revolution. It was more like basically a bunch of people got drunk, and when they woke up the next morning, they were all Communists. Right, Right. Questions or comments so far? Let me just kill the Tsar and his. His family before this, or was it after the civil war that they. They killed off? It was. It was during the Civil war. But we're not there yet. Okay, so, so now here the. Let me just mention to you that this congress I've been talking about is called the Soviet Congress. You have to wonder, what does the word Soviet actually mean? The answer is that a Soviet is a workers council. The way that it worked was that every one of the factories had organized a Soviet, which is a council of the workers in the factory. And their expectation is that when the revolution happens and they get rid of the ownership of the factory, which in this case is the state, they will be the ones who run the factory, the Soviets. Right? So when they call this congress, the Soviet Congress, what it basically is, is a representative from all the different factories that are making decisions for the state. And this is the, the communist idea of pure democracy, right? That, that rather than being ruled by an upper class, we're doing all the ruling ourselves. Basically, those, the work, the state is being run by the workers. You guys get what I'm saying? That's the idea behind Soviets, right? So one of the big lies behind the Soviet system is the idea that the workers are actually participating in it, right? They may be meeting, but they're not participating in anything. The decisions are all made by people like Kerensky and Lenin. And here's another guy down here, Trotsky. Right? Okay. And that's the way it will be as they go into the Soviet Union, as they go into the Communist state. I just wanted you to know that that's where that idea, where the word Soviet plays into this communist event. All right? Questions, Comments about that? Okay, so now what happens then is that there's actually an election between the Bolsheviks and everybody else, essentially, and the Bolsheviks lose the election. So they said, well, it's not fair, it's rigged, right? It's been stolen. And so they refused to acknowledge and they continue to publish their decrees on peace, land and bread, right? Peace, land and bread. Basically out of the war, people get to farm the land and we're gonna, everybody's gonna get fed, right? And that's going to lead then to civil war. The civil war between the Red Russians, who are essentially the Bolsheviks, and the White Russians, who are essentially everybody else. Although there are supporters of the monarchy in there, all right? And that's gonna last from 1918 until 1923. And in 1918, the czar and his family will be executed, right? Which is another story altogether. But at any rate, the point here is that this civil war was accompanied by brutal, state sponsored, essentially terrorism where people were given the, the mandate to find People who were enemies of the revolution and summarily execute them without trial. Right. And so it's called a terror at the same time, the Red Terror. Right. And I imagine it was a terror. Right? And in. In the middle of all this, the governments of the United States and Germany. No, was it. Governments of the United States and Britain and France will intervene in Russia to try to help the White Russians. And the Japanese will also invade Russia in the East. Eventually the. The Western powers will leave, but the Japanese stay. And that's going to be part of the. The issue that happens with World War II. Right. But by 1923, because of the leadership of this man here, Leon Trotsky, the Reds win. The. I didn't really show you this picture, did I? This is Lenin giving his speech. We're taking over, essentially. Right? Okay. So at any rate, by 1923, the Reds are fully in control of the state, and they established what's known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Now, one of the things that happens even earlier than this is going to be the Treaty of Brest Litovsk where the Russians drop out of the war, all right? And the Russians had to give up a lot of territory in order to achieve the peace. But Lenin really thought that it was worth it. I want you to just notice this because it will be interesting for us to think about what happened to Russia when we start to think about the end of World War I and the treaty of Versailles. Just keep that in mind. Any questions or comments about this? All right, so I went too far out, okay, so now there's a conflict in. Lenin dies, okay, Very quickly. He was very sick for a long time, and he finally dies in 1924. And now there's. There's a conflict over who's going to take over. Is it going to be Stalin or Trotsky? And, you know, behind that, I think, is the. The idea that Stalin was authoritarian in nature. He basically. He basically had a hunger for power. Trotsky was more of a. An intellectual, and he was also a little bit more doctrinaire. Right, so the big question then that all of this kind of centers around is, is it possible to have communism in one country? And Stalin says, yes, you can have communism in one country. And Trotsky says, no, you can't have communism in one country. Either there's going to be communism everywhere or there's going to be communism nowhere, because communism and capitalism are mutually exclusive. And that was kind of endorsed. That idea was endorsed by Lenin himself. This is what Lenin said. The existence of the Soviet republic alongside the imperialist states over the long run is unthinkable. In the end, either the one or the other will triumph. And until that end will have arrived a series of the most terrible conflicts between the Soviet republic and the bourgeois governments is unavoidable. This means that the ruling class, the proletariat, if it only wishes to rule and is to rule, must demonstrate this only also with its military organization. All right, now, this is the basis for the Cold War, essentially, and for the red scares, right? The red scares basically were. People were afraid of communism. Well, why were people afraid of communism? Because the communists said that they were going to destroy the countries that were not communist, which would include Britain and the United States and France and Germany. Right? Okay. So now the end of this conflict between Stalin and Trotsky is that Trotsky is forced into exile. He lives in Mexico City and has an affair with Frida Kahlo. And then somebody there was an attempt on his life. So he built this big, very thick walled house where if he was attacked, he could close himself in and nobody could get to him, right? And so what happened was this guy was recruited to become his friend, and one day his friend went into his office and murdered him. That's what we have here. That shows the kind of politics that was practiced by the Soviet state because Stalin was behind all this, right? And then we see. Well, just leave it there. Okay, so. So that's the end of that. That. That argument. Although the. The Soviets. The government. The Russia. The communist government in Russia, which really wasn't communist, right. Does believe that they have to spread communism everywhere, right? So they form a committee called the Communist International Committee or the Common Turn. Okay, Communist International Committee. Let's see, who haven't I not picked on? How about. What about Francisco? Francisco, are you there? Yeah. What does common turn stand for? Comment Turn. Yeah, the Common Turn. I don't know exactly. Well, I just said it. I just. Exactly. I know it's crazy. I said it less than a minute ago. All right, somebody help him out. Eric, can you help him out? Eric's not even there. I guess somebody help him out. Organization to spread communism around the globe, right? What is this? What is Common Turn? What is common. I mean, this International Committee, right? Communist International Committee. I want you to remember this. It doesn't really have the committee part in there, but Commerce International, it does. Communist International. I want you to remember this because this is the basis for the Cold War, right? You're saying. Wait a minute, the Cold War doesn't happen until after World War II. That's true to a certain extent. All right. But really this is the beginning of the Cold War right here where the Soviets say they make it a state policy to export communism everywhere. Okay. And so just keep that in mind. And then the result of that, obviously is going to be the red scares in the west, particularly in the United States. After World War I, there was an enormous red scare. This is kind of some of the propaganda that comes out of that. All right? And you know, to be fair, after the Soviet Union came into existence, really as a result of the revolution and the Civil War, Soviet industry was dead. Right. So when we see this picture of the closed factories and shut down factories and things like that, that really did happen in Russia, in the Soviet Union. All right, so that criticism is actually valid. All right. And we'll talk about that when we come back from Thanksgiving when we start talking about the, the interwar years in the Great Depression. All right, what time is it? 1:40. Okay, so everybody put your head on the desk. I'm just kidding. I'm done. I'll see you on Thursday. Live long and prosper. Have a good one. Thank you, Professor. Elementary school. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Heads up. Seven up. Ciao. All right. Have a good one, guy. See you guys on Thursday. Hello, Professor. I'm not sure if you got my email or not, but it's about. I did get your email. Okay. I have. Here's what terms about the midterm. Well, you didn't do it, right? I did. I would be concerned about it too. Yeah. Well, did you know that you knew that there was going to be a midterm, right? I didn't actually. Well, why didn't you? I talked about it. I talked about it in class every day for the last few weeks. And it's in syllabus and it's on canvas. Right. Remember I. I gave you guys a. A midterm study guide right here. Midterm study guide. And then here's the exam. And the exam says you are required to work as a group. Yes. You see? So I don't understand. But, but I understand that you probably announcing that it's my fault that I didn't know about this, but I didn't even know about the midterm until yesterday. Until I saw that. I was wondering what this whole thing grading our peers was. And I thought maybe it was just something in class that we were grading them, but. Well, you know, on the day of the midterm, I put everybody in their groups, right? Was there a time that we were supposed to, like, meet together or something? Like my group? Yeah, I put all the groups in during class period. On the day of the midterm, I put everybody in groups. Okay. Then I don't know. If I wasn't there on that day or something, I don't know what happened. Have you missed any days? I don't call a roll every day I think I've missed one day. Right, Well, I can't help you with that. Okay. But what I will say is that there is extra credit available, so you do all the extra credit you can and do the best on everything else, and this isn't going to kill you. You can still pass the class. All right. Even if you get a zero on the midterm. Okay. Yeah. You can still actually probably still get an A if you do all the work. Right. So just keep that in mind. Don't be discouraged. But you should take this as a learning opportunity to know that you need to pay attention to the syllabus and you need to pay attention in class. When I'm giving instructions in the first part of the class and realizing this is my first semester in college, and I'm realizing now everything's hitting me like a train out of nowhere. Yeah. Okay. Well, I mean, it can be overwhelming, but you. You're. You're smart enough to get through it. You can do it. Right? You just got to pay attention. You take responsibility for making sure that you've done everything that you need to do. Does that make sense? Yes. Okay. All right. So as far as the. The extra credit. Well, there isn't any right now, but I'm. I'll be putting more up. You just keep your eye out for it. I remember. Okay. Extra credit. It was like, if it wasn't submitted, then it didn't go through or whatever. Yeah, there'll be more. Don't worry about it. I'll put more up. Okay. All right. Thank you. All right. Should I submit the peer review? What should I do for that? Well, I mean, if you didn't participate, you're probably not. You don't have any way of reviewing your peers? No, I don't, but there's no grade on that anyway. Okay. Okay. Thank you, Professor. All right. Have a Thursday.

You guys like my song? Did you guys like my song? Does anybody want to guess why I played that song today? Come on, what are we talking about today? You played that song. Because today's topic is going to be about the independence of Latin America. Right. And what was. What was Bob Marley thinking about standing for your rights? And what do you think these independence revolutions were about? Marijuana. Marijuana. They've talked about standing for your rights. Okay. So how's everybody doing today? Let me go ahead and just stop the share here for a second. How's everybody doing today? Everybody's good. Doing good. Now, is there anything that I can help you with? Anything you need help with? Any questions about anything that's going on right now? I noticed that most of you did the discussion, which was good. And I'll be looking at that later to tomorrow probably. And we've got. Coming up, I think next Thursday is going to be our midterm. So don't, don't sweat that right now. But by Thursday I'll have. By this Thursday I'll have some more stuff together for you guys on how that's going to happen. Okay, so. So just so that you know that that's coming up, one of the things that I'm going to try to do is to get all the recordings online so that you can actually go, go through the lectures if you need to, if you. Pretty good notes. Anything else that I can help you with? No, we're good. Okay. So today we're going to continue talking about the age of democratic revolutions. Remember, we stopped with the French Revolution. So when we talked about the age of democratic revolutions, we said that there was a revolution in America and that there was a revolution in France and that the outcome of the revolution in America was a constitutional republic. But the outcome of the revolution in France was warfare and eventually the restoration of the monarchy. And so one of the things that characterizes the outcome of the American Revolution from the point of view of Americans and liberals around the world is that the United States was seen, the American Revolution was seen as a revolution that was the spark of liberty with an exclamation point. So now let's see if we can remember what is liberty with an exclamation point or the other name for it is classical liberalism. Liberty or democracy, Secularism and capitalism. Democracy, secularism and capitalism. That was. That is actually the dominant political ideology in the world today. The very first country that did it using ideals of the Enlightenment, was the United States. When the revolution happened in the United States, by the end of the revolution, it was believed by many people that that was just the beginning of a worldwide revolution of liberty, that the United States was first and then France was next. Because you'll recall that I told you that when France was beginning its revolution, the Americans were there encouraging them with the idea that this was a natural evolution, that liberty would spread to France and then eventually would spread to England and around Europe and in the Americas and everywhere. Eventually everywhere. Right? So this idea that liberalism was going to be the new dawn. Thomas Paine wrote in the American Revolution that we have the opportunity to begin the world anew. Right? We're going to start all over with this. We're going to get rid of the ancien regime, the old order of the three estates and we're going to, we're going to establish this new civilization based on liberty and enlightenment. Okay, and the, then I told you about the American Revolution, the French Revolution. We didn't talk about Spanish American revolutions. That's what we're going to talk about today. But with that idea of the liberal revolution eventually being triumphant, we come up with the name for this era as the age of Democratic revolutions. But you'll remember that when I discussed that I put democratic in quotes. Does anybody remember why? Why did I say if I put it in quotes, what does that mean about the democratic part? That it wasn't democratic. It wasn't really democratic. Right. So then what did I say about the outcomes of these revolutions? Did it fall into the liberal democracy? No. They essentially failed. No. Didn't they get out of control or at least in France out of control? Well, how many actually did end up with a liberal democracy? The United States. That's it. That's the only one. Right. Okay, so what we're going to do now is we're going to focus in on what happened in Spanish America. We'll just leave it right now. I'm just going to go through it. But what I want you to notice here is on the presentation, I put a timeline. And the reason why I put the timeline, I'm not going to go through the timeline right now, but I'm going to keep referring back to it. And the reason why is because this era is extremely complicated. There's a lot going on. Keep in mind that we're not talking about now a revolution in one country like the United States or like France. We're talking about a revolution in 24 different countries. So what we try to do is to categorize it in such a way that you can understand what happened at the same time, keeping in mind that every country was different. Okay? So we'll have to leave it at that. But where we're going to start is at the, about the same time as the, the so called era of benign neglect. Do you guys remember the era of benign neglect that we talked about that was part of this lecture on the age of democratic revolutions? Who was neglecting who, those in those in power or neglecting those without it? Okay, kind of. Okay, see this is, this is telling me that you guys don't remember what I told you like a couple weeks ago. But what if you remember, England went through civil war and then there was a glorious revolution where the king was forced to flee. And then England became embroiled in its own domestic politics and what that meant was that during this period between 1700 and 1765, the British continued to rule America in name, but they were unable to enforce their rule in America. Okay. And so this era then becomes the era of benign neglect. And if you, if you can remember what I talked about then and why it was important that I talked about it then was that is when the taxes that they were using to fuel their wars back in England or. No, that's going to be. That's going to be coming up. Just. That's. That's going to be coming up. What I'm talking about now is that while England was neglecting the Americas, not on purpose, but because they really couldn't enforce their will, Americans developed a sense of independence. Right. And what brought that to an end was the Seven Years War or the French and Indian War, if you guys will remember me talking about that. The French and Indian War was a war that started in America, but it becomes a worldwide contest between Britain and France. And Spain was in there as well. Right. Okay. So one of the outcomes of the French or the Seven Years War is that the British and, well, the French lost all their colonies in the Americas. The British and Spanish realized that they had lost control of their empires. And so both the Spanish, the British and the Spanish tried to reestablish their colonial control over America starting in 1765. Right. And this is where we come in to the taxes that Aaron was talking about, because the British then try to tax the Americans. Actually the Parliament tries to tax the Americans. And the Americans say, well, we don't pay taxes to the Parliament because we're not represented in Parliament. That was their. The idea of giving consent to taxation we talked about from Locke. You guys remember all this, right? More or less. Okay, so what happened in Spain was a little bit different. And let me just show you it has the same effect. Let me go back. I didn't finish this when I started talking about taxes. The end result was the American Revolution that happens in 1776. Right. And that we see the American colonies break away from Great Britain, the mother country. Okay, so keep that in mind. That this attempt to re establish control, excuse me, colonial control over America by the British ends up with revolution and they lose their colonies. Okay, so now let's take a look at Spain. By now, actually, when we're looking at this period of time, Spain, England is on the rise. England is becoming more and more powerful. But Spain is in decline. And one of the reasons why Spain is in decline is because they extracted all this wealth from America, but they blew it all on religious wars, if you guys will recall. Right? So the Spanish Empire is not well off financially. The British are actually controlling the trade. And then the other part of it was that in the Spanish Empire, all of the authority of the government rested in the king. All of the authority of the government rested in the king. So now let's think about if the king is wise and capable, then the empire will be wise and capable. But if the king is an idiot, then the empire will be idiotic. Do you guys get what I'm saying? That was, that was kind of big argument about, about monarchy, that monarchy is good if the monarch is good, but it's bad if the monarch is bad. And the way they choose the monarch is by heredity, which means that you could end up with anybody in charge of the government. You guys are with me. So that's a problem with the, with the Spanish Empire. But up until this time, what we can see is that we talked about mercantilism. And mercantilism was that the colonies could only trade with the mother country. And the way that that was controlled in Spain was that all of the trade was accomplished through a single fleet that was sent that went from Spain to America and did trade fairs in America. And then the result of those trade fairs was that they would take back the treasure from America to Spain. So every year there was a treasure fleet. And you guys may or may not know about the pirates of the Caribbean and all that stuff. All that was based on the idea that there was one fleet per year that left from the Americas and ended up in Spain. And so if you attack that fleet, you could gather all of the wealth that had been extracted from the Americas that year. You guys follow me here. And keep in mind that what we're extracting from America there is some gold, but it's mostly silver and agricultural goods. Okay? But any rate, the point is that there's a lot of treasure, okay? And then the American colonies were not allowed to trade with anybody else. They couldn't even trade with each other, okay? And then one other thing that happened during this period was that the Spanish established a once a year fleet that went from Acapulco to Manila in the Philippines to trade with Asia. Okay? So so basically then let's say that you're in Spain and the trade in Manila was basically trade with China, right? So let's say that you're in Spain and you want to order dishes from China. What you would have to do is you'd place an order with the fleet. The Spanish fleet would go to America, then they would cross America with that order, and then the Manila galleon would go to Manila and come back. And then the next year at the trade fair, your dishes would be delivered and then brought back to Seville. And if the fleet wasn't attacked, then you'd get traditions after two years. Basically, you guys, you see how that works? Okay? So. So it was not very efficient in terms of economics, right? So this is the treasure fleet. This is actually a Manila galleon, what they call the Manila gallium. Now, in the Americas, what has happened is that there are two different groups of Spanish people, right? So now what we want to keep in mind is that these two different groups are not mixed race. They're both white Europeans. The difference between them is some of them are born in Spain and some of them are born in America. And I don't know, I hope that you guys remember when we talked about the American Revolution and we talked about Creole patriotism, we talked about the relationship between Europeans and Americans, where Europeans felt that Americans were inferior simply by the fact that they were born in America, right? So in the Spanish Empire, these two groups are called criollos and peninsulares, right? Criollos are Creoles who are born in America from Spanish parents. And peninsulares are people who come directly from the peninsula, the Iberian Peninsula. What we see happening during this period of time, again, going back to this timeline here, during this period of time, the criollos are actually taking control and, and developing a sense of independence from the Spanish monarchy. The Spanish monarchy is losing control of the Americas. In fact, what ends up happening is that the purpose of having colonies was to provide revenue for the monarchy. And by the time we get to the Beginning of the 18th century, the colonies were actually a drain on the Spanish treasury. Okay? But at any rate, then when we go back to this talk about criollos and peninsulares, criollos have basically taken control of the colonies, except that the highest offices, the archbishop and the Viceroy, the offices of Viceroy and archbishop were always held by peninsulares, people from the peninsula. They were appointed by the king, but every other office had been. Had been basically taken over by locals by criollos. And so they too had developed this sense of independence, like the British North Americans. Okay? And one of the things that we see happening in Spanish America, just like in British North America, was that the peninsulares treat the criollos with disrespect. They look down on them, they think they're lazy and stupid, a bunch of ignorant hicks. Right. And that they can't, they're not on the same level as Europeans. Okay, you guys follow me here. Questions, comments, and the Criollos know that. And so there is this friction that develops between Criollos and Peninsulares. But keep in mind, now that both the Criollos and the Peninsulares are white. Okay? They're not, they're not mixed race. Okay. And so one of the things that I found that I thought was interesting is to show you here that this is kind of the, the, the, the cast makeup in Spanish America. And we have again, the peninsulares, people born in Spain, criollos who are born in America of European parentage. And then we have two different groups of mixed race, mestizos and mulattos. Mestizos more in Mexico and maybe in Peru and Chile. But mulatto is in areas where there's a big slave population in the Spanish empire, which wasn't true that much in Mexico. And then underneath that are Native Americans and Africans. Right. So you guys see how the caste system works. If you're pure native or pure black, you're at the bottom. If you're white, you're at the top. That's it. Okay. There's no, there's no, there's no movement from the bottom to the top. Okay. You could actually, interestingly, move around in here, right? So you could go from a lower level mestizo to a higher level mestizo by paying money to the, to the, to the monarchy. But the rest of this was fixed. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. Okay, so now let's talk about what happens. This is actually, let me just show you the map here. This is by the time we get to 1700. Okay. We have. Well, actually 1800, we'll say we have. The Spanish empire has been divided into viceroyalties. Okay. And the viceroyalties are New Spain, which includes Mexico. What's today Mexico? The American southwest, the Caribbean islands. Florida would be part of that for a period of time. And then also the Philippines. Right. So the new vice royalty of New Spain was a huge area, a huge kind of administrative area of Spain that had at one point been the kind of the jewel in the Spanish crown. This is where they got most of their wealth. Okay. And then there was the viceroyalty of New Granada, which includes Central America and Venezuela and other countries. And then there was the viceroyalty of Peru, which includes Peru and what is today Chile. And then there was the Viceroyalty of La Plata, which include what we call today Argentina, And Colombia. Excuse me, Bolivia, and a couple other countries. Okay, so this was essentially the way that the empire was ruled, was that the king had all the power, but the viceroys who were appointed to rule in America spoke with the king's voice. Right? So if. If the king wanted something done, he would make that known to the viceroy, and then the viceroy would make it happen. Okay. He had the authority of the king. Okay, we keep that in mind. Right now that the authority of the viceroy comes from the king. It is the king's authority. It's not his own authority. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? I. I hope I'm not going too far afield. I hope you guys are following this. All right, so now what happens in Spain in 1700? Let's go back. Let's go all the way back to the beginning, 1492. Columbus sailed the ocean blue and discovered America. And then not long after that was Charles the fifth, the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles the First, the king of Spain. And not long after that, he. He. Excuse me, that was Ferdinand and Isabella. And then Charles became king Charles the First. And the ruling family from the beginning of the 17th century to the beginning of the 18th century was the Habsburgs. Remember, Charles V was Habsburg. Habsburg are Austrian. Okay, what happens is the last of the Habsburgs dynasty named Charles II came to power in the middle of the 18th 17th century, 1600s, and he ruled for 35 years. But there was a problem, and there's some disagreement on how much this problem played into the events that happened. But the fact of the matter was that the Habsburgs were inbred, that the Habsburgs married within the family. And the reason why they did that was so they could keep their estates together. So that if. If somebody was in control of an estate, they didn't want them marrying outside the family and then losing that part of the estate. So what we see happening then is centuries of inbreeding in the Habsburg family and that those centuries of inbreeding end up with this Charles ii. Right. Charles II was physically deformed, and some people argued, mentally defective, crazy. And he was called el echizado, which means the bewitched one. Right? He was the bewitched one because he was, like I said, he was deformed and he was essentially weak. Everybody expected him to die from the time that he was born, but he hung in there for, like, 39 years. Okay, so he was the king of Spain for quite some time. And that's what I meant when I said, if the king is an Idiot, then the kingdom is an idiot. The empire is ruled by an idiot, essentially. Right? Okay, so in 1700, Charles dies, leaving no heir, but he had chosen this person, Philip of Anjou, who was of the House of Bourbon. Bourbon. Bourbon is what they call it, okay, as his heir. The problem with that, from the point of view of other European powers like Britain and Austria, is that if Spain, if Spain's king comes from the House of Bourbon, then that would mean that Spain's lands, empire essentially would be in the hands of the ruling family of France, because the Bourbon were the ruling family of France. You guys get what I'm saying? So there was a war. The war lasted, I think, six or seven years. And at the end of the war, they came to a decision, an agreement that Philip would be king of Spain, but it would be completely separate from the French monarchy. Okay? And so basically then we see a change of dynasty from the Habsburgs to the Bourbon. Okay? In Spain they call them Bourbon. Right? Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? The reason why that's important is because the Bourbon realized that their empire is in disarray and they set about on a series of reforms that are called the Bourbon reforms, basically. Right? I know you guys think I'm talking about whiskey, but I'm not. Okay? The Bourbon reforms were basically a reorganization of the political administration and the economic organization, first of Spain and then in the colonies. Right? So remember I told you how the colonies had become a drain on the royal treasury and Bourbon set in motion policies that would remake the empire into a money making proposition. The way that they did that was to take the power out of the hands of the Criollos and put it back into the hands of peninsulares. Okay, so, so now you guys get what I'm saying. What effect do you think that's going to have on American society? It'll throw it into who's in control in America. I'm sorry, think about this now. Who's in control in America? Before the Bourbon reforms, who's in control? The creoles, criollos or peninsulares? Okay? So now once the Bourbon reforms go into effect, the criollos, who are the people with power in the Americas, all of a sudden lose all their power. How do you think they're going to react to that? They're not going to like that. Plus they're not going to like it. And so this is when, this is when they start talking about independence. Okay? These, these creolos in America start to talk about independence at the exact same time that the Creoles in North America start to talk about independence and essentially for the same reason because the, the mother country is trying to re. Establish its colonial control over the Americans and they are chafing under the. Essentially the slavery or the. I'm trying to think about the oppression of colonialism. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this. Now I just wanted to show you this picture. This guy here is Jose de Galvez and he was called the visitador. A visitador was the person who came, who on a mission from the king to, to do a study. Right. And he came to America to do a study of the empire and it was his idea to introduce these reforms in America. Right? So, so basically Jose de Galvez was the kind of the author of the Bourbon reforms in America. Interestingly, the way that we know him in the United States is that the city of Galveston is named after him. Right. And another interesting thing about him was that he decided that rather than spending money on armed forces in America, they should recruit guerrillas to fight as an army. Right. He never did actually do that, but that was his idea. Okay, questions? Comments about any of this? Okay, now keep that in mind. There's already this sense of tension. There's already this tension between Americans and Spanish, between Criollos and peninsulares, and between American administration and the royal government. Okay? And now we're going to throw into the mix Napoleon. Okay? Now what happens in Napoleon in, in the late 1700s. Actually, you know that Napoleon came to power after the French Revolution, Right? And when he came to power, he actually conducted waged wars around Europe. And the, the, the, let's say the stated purpose of those wars was that he was spreading liberty. The reality was that he was building an empire. So again, as I've mentioned to you before, Napoleon is kind of an enigma because we don't really know what was his. Was he really trying to spread liberty or was he just trying to empower himself? And that's basically open for debate, but what happens is that the Kingdom of Spain allies with France. The guy who's the Prime Minister, Manuel de Godoy, realizes that France has got the winning hand, so he creates an alliance with France. Okay? Now in 18. Well, not early 1800s, before 1806, 1805, France declares war on Portugal. I'm not going to give you a reason why it's kind of complicated. But the main thing is that France declares war on Portugal and Spain joins the war. One of the reasons why was because Portugal was essentially a client state of Britain. Okay? So Spain joins the war against Portugal. The reason why is because the. Actually Manuel de Godoy has been given assurances by Napoleon that if they conquer Portugal, he's going to gain half of it as his personal estate. Right? But what ends up happening is then that there's already French troops in Spain. And in 1807, Napoleon deposes the monarchy. He's already got troops in Spain. Yeah, he's already got troops in Spain. And so what happens is that he deposes the monarchy. The monarch was Charles iii, and then he is. He abdicates in favor of his son, Ferdinand vii, and then Ferdinand VII is forced to abdicate and carried into exile in France, and Napoleon places his brother Joseph, Joseph Bonaparte on the throne of Spain. Right? So now what happens in Spain as a result of this is that there's a war between those people in Spain who support the monarchy and those people who in Spain who support Napoleon, okay, Which is called the Peninsular War. And then kind of in the middle of all this, there's another group that forms of liberals who say that they want to get rid of Napoleon, but they don't want the king to be replaced, or if he is replaced, they want him to be under a constitution, no longer an absolute monarch. In 1810, this new group calls Cortes, which was a parliament, kind of, which had been based on the three estates, okay? But it becomes a new kind of a congress at the port of Cadiz, which is right here. You can't see it, Right, but it's. You can't see it here, but it's actually down here. Right? But any rate, at the port of Cadiz. And so this is called the Cortes de Cadiz in 1810. And they. This group, this ruling council that they establish is what we'll call a liberal junta. Keep that in mind for a minute. And they ultimately, they write a constitution, the Constitution of 1812. And what this constitution does is it creates kind of like a United States of Spain, okay? So what it does is it makes Spain one country, and then say New Spain would be a country and New Granada would be a country and Rio de la Plata would be a country, and they would all be represented in the Cortes in the same way that states in the United States are represented in Congress. You guys get what I'm saying? So each one of these countries will be independent, but they would all be under the umbrella of the Spanish Kingdom, okay? And the kingdom was a constitutional kingdom, constitutional monarchy, like England. All right, guys, got that? Questions? Comments about this? Now, let's go back and look at the timeline here, okay? And remember, we Talked about this era here creates a lot of. A lot of tension between the Americans and the Spanish. And then in 1808, Napoleon invades Spain. The King is deposed, and Philip Joseph, sorry, Joseph Bonaparte becomes the new king of Spain. Okay, now remember, I started off by talking about who has all the authority in the Spanish Empire, the Holy Roman Empire. No, what did I say? Here? Look. What does it say? The King. The King. The king. Remember I said that the king was in absolute control of the empire. That's why I call him an absolute monarch. Right. And nothing happened without the King's permission. But obviously the empire is big. So the King has divided his kingdom up into viceroyalties. Right. And the viceroy. What is the. What is the role of the viceroy? To carry out, what, the king's orders. Right. And what authority does he have to do that? The king's authority. The authority from God. The king's authority, exactly right. Remember I said that the Viceroy is essentially the king in America. He doesn't have any authority on his own, but he has the king's authority. Right. So now let's say that we're living in America. Say we're living in Mexico City in 17, 1808. Right? And I'm the Viceroy of New Spain, and I am essentially the King of. Of New Spain. But by what authority am I the King of New Spain? By whose authority? By the King of New Spain. The king. King at this time was King of Spain. Right. The King of Spain was Charles iii. Then it became Ferdinand vii, Then it became Joseph Bonaparte. Okay? So if I'm the Viceroy of Mexico and Joseph Bonaparte is the king, do I have any. Do I view Joseph Bonaparte as a legitimate king? You would consider him a foreigner. Right? He's not the king. The authority that I wield is the authority of the King of Spain, not Joseph Bonaparte. Right. So Americans reject the idea of being ruled by Joseph Bonaparte. Okay. And this is going to be across the board. Okay? So this is a picture of Joseph Bonaparte. What happens? There's basically two different things that happen in America now. Okay? The first one, it's really similar to what happened in Spain, because in Spain, we saw those in support of the royalists rebel against the French. And then there was another group that formed a liberal junta who was. Who wanted to replace the monarchy with a constitutional monarchy. Right? And then they wrote this constitution. So we see the same thing happening in various places in America, right? We see liberal juntas form, for example, in Rio de la Plata and in Peru and in New Granada and in Mexico or New Spain, right? But these liberal juntas end up being opposed to the viceroys, right? So the viceroys continue to rule in the name of the king, but these liberal juntas say, well, we're going to get rid of the king altogether and we're going to have our own country, right? We're going to get up and stand up for our rights, okay? You get what I'm saying? But now here's the. How should I say this? Here's the way that it works out, okay? We look here in La Plata, the liberals are able to take control, okay? The liberal junta takes control In New Granada, eventually the liberals will gain control, although it will take a long time, right? But in New Spain and in Peru, the royalists remain in control. The viceroys remain in control. Now you have to say, well, why those two countries and not these two countries? Right? And the answer to that is because New Spain and Peru were the sources of the most wealth from the Americas, okay? And so that meant that the people who were in control in New Spain and in Peru were invested in the preservation of the monarchy because that's where they got their power and authority, right? So the, the monarchy remains pretty much embedded in Peru and in New Spain, particularly what we're going to call Mexico, although it didn't really exist at that time, Right? And then we see a movement towards liberalism in New Granada and La Plata. Okay? Are you guys still following me? I know, it's, it's, it's. It's kind of confusing. So what we're going to see happening then is two independence movements in South America. One of them comes from La Plata and the other one comes from New Granada, okay? And the one that comes from La Plata is going to be led by a man named Jose de San Martin. And the one that run, that comes from New Granada is going to be led by a man named Sivon Bolivar. Okay? You probably have heard of Bolivar. He's probably the only one of these people that you've ever heard of, right? And you probably don't know very much about him, but we're going to talk a little bit about him today, okay? So that's looking at them now. Let's go back and take a look. We have two different movements, a southern movement and a northern movement in South America. In South America, what happens? Buenos Aires is the center of opposition, like I mentioned to you. The liberal junta there was able to take control and establish a liberal government, right? And then Jose de San Martin is given command of the junta forces to put down the Royalist forces in La Plata, which is basically today Argentina. Right? And then he decides he's going to liberate Peru. Okay? The problem, of course, is that Peru is far away. It's across the Andes, okay? The Andes are almost impassable. All right? So if you look at, for example, at this picture that I, I have at. On the, the, the COVID here, this is a painting of San Martin crossing the Andes. Okay? He crosses the Andes and he invades Chile. Right? And the reason why is because Chile is weaker. It's not as well defended as Peru as Lima, which is basically where he wants to go. So he invades Chile, takes control of Chile, and then eventually invades Peru. All right, so we go back then to the map. I should probably do this differently next time. I will. Right, but he goes back to. He. He leads the independence of Peru and he's actually appointed basically the leader of liberalized Peru. Right? But the royalists have not been completely put down yet in Peru. And so what happens is that he needs help, all right? And, and while this is all happening, there's a similar movement happening in the north, which we're going to talk about in a minute, that was led by Bolivar. Right? And what happens is that San Martin and Bolivar meet at a place called Guayaquil. And nobody actually knows what they talked about there, but what everybody does know is that San Martin left the meeting, went resigned from his post in Peru and went into exile. And that was the end of San Martin. And then the rest of the independence movement was led by Bolivar. Okay? So again, nobody knows what they said, but it was probably not too pleasant for San Martin. Okay, questions, comments about this? Are you guys all still following me or are we lost? Is Bolivia. Is Bolivia where Bolivia gets its name? Yes, he is, because Bolivar is called El Libertador. The liberator. Liberator, Right? Even though he. He was only. He was only half of the liberators. The other one was San Martin. San Martin is mostly forgotten because he went into exile. Okay, questions. That's a good question. Any other questions, comments about any of this? All right, so now let's talk about the Northern Movement. It was a lot more complicated. This is Bolivar right here. Wait, I have a question. Let's go back to the timeline here. Brief. Okay. Okay. Can I go? Yeah, she. Please. Okay, sorry. There's a little bit of yes, go live. But the, the question I want to ask was that. So does that mean that pretty much all of South America was kind of, I guess, liberated by the same people, right? By These two. By these two different people, San Martin and Bolivar. But keep in mind that, that South America was divided into only two viceroyalties at the time. New Granada and. Oh, no, three. New Granada, Peru and. And La Plata. Does that answer your question? Yeah. Thank you. Okay. All right, so now I want to go back to the timeline for a minute. And so here's where we are, right in here, right? And one thing that happened that we didn't talk about yet, but this is back in Spain, right, in 1814, Napoleon was defeated and the Spanish monarchy was restored. So Ferdinand VII becomes king of Spain again in 1814. Okay. But Ferdinand was not in favor of the liberal constitution. Ferdinand basically thought that he should be able to rule as an absolute monarch, as all of his predecessors had. And so he nullified the constitution. And what makes this important is that if you remember when we talked about the different areas in the Americas, can you guess which areas would have been in favor of the Constitution and which areas would have been opposed to it? Or let's say it another way, what group would have been more in favor of the constitution and what group would have been more opposed to it? The Criollos and the peninsulares would be for it. I mean, against it. Against it. Yeah. Who, who's against it now? Peninsularis the people from Europe, you said both, you said. Well, criolas would be. Right. The Peninsular are against the Constitution and the Creole is mostly are for it. Right. And keep in mind that the criollos, I mean, the peninsulares are still in control in New Spain or still powerful in New Spain and Peru, and they're weaker in New Granada and La Plata. Right. So what happens then is that when the Constitution is restored, people in Peru are no longer in rebellion against the King. They're actually happy about what happened. And people in these other areas are sad because they've lost this liberal constitution that they had. Okay? So keep that in mind. Right. But then what happens? That after the, after the restoration of the monarchy, the King sees all of the problems that are happening in America, all of the rebellion that's happening in America, and he decides to send an army, armies to America to basically restore control, okay? And he's there. They're met with some success, but a lot of failure. Okay? And so he decides then in 1820, he's going to build this enormous army that he's going to send to America and end this constitution business once and for all. This army is camped outside of Madrid, which is where the King of Spain is, and there's a Rebellion led by a colonel named Riego. And the rebellion demands that the Constitution be restored. Okay? And the king gives into that. So in 1820, the liberal constitution is restored. Let's think about the constitution now. 1812, the constitution is promulgated. 1814, it's nullified. And now in 1820, it's restored. In 1812, the liberal constitution is going to resonate with people from the Americas, the criollos. In 1814, nullifying the Constitution is going to encourage the Peninsulares. And now restoring the Constitution. What effect do you think that will have on, on the peninsularities? Do they like it or not like it? They're gonna, they're not gonna like it. They're gonna feel defeated. They don't like it. Okay? But now here's what's interesting, is that all this time these leaders have been fighting, these military leaders in America have been fighting for the monarchy, and now the monarchy has become a liberal monarchy, a constitutional monarchy. They don't want to fight for it anymore, essentially. So it's going to be the restoration of the Constitution that is kind of the turning point in the independence of all of Spanish America, because the peninsulares who are fighting in favor of the monarchy are basically going to lose faith in the monarchy. Okay? So basically then what happens is that this guy Bolivar is going to lead a number of different movements in the northern part of South America and not really have a lot of luck until after 1820. After 1820, he's going to be able to essentially mop up because the military leaders from the empire no longer support the empire. Okay, so it's going to be 1821, it's going to be the liberation of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Panama. And what he does then is he creates a big country called Gran Colombia, which is basically this area here, right? Eventually there's three different countries there that are going to, they're going to rebel, okay? But for now, we can say that because of the, because of the restoration of the constitution, the northern liberation movement was successful. And so by 1824, all of South America that was under control of the Spanish Empire is independent. Okay? And theoretically they're all independent with liberal governments. Okay, questions, comments about this, guys? Follow me here. All right. Okay, let me just briefly talk about Brazil. Okay? Brazil is not part of Spanish America because Brazil was actually colonized by Portugal. Okay? And the reason why was because the pope in the 16th century divided the world between Portugal and Spain. Nobody asked the Chinese about that. But, but he divided, they divided the world between Portugal and Spain. And it just so happened that the dividing line in the Atlantic separated Spanish holdings from what, this area here. So the Portuguese then took control and they established a colony there. And this colony becomes pretty, pretty lucrative. It's a very. It's a very. It's a big money maker, essentially. But what happens, though, is that eventually the money that's coming from Brazil ends up filtering through the merchants in Britain. So essentially, Portugal becomes a kind of a puppet state of Britain. Okay. And then when Napoleon invades Portugal, we talked about it at the beginning, the British fleet carries the Brazilian or the Portuguese monarchy to Rio de Janeiro, and they established the court there. So Brazil was the only country in history that went from being a colony to being a metropolis. And Portugal is the only country in history that went from being a monopoly, excuse me, a metropolis, to being a colony. Okay. After the war, this will all change, but that's basically what happens in Brazil. Okay, questions? Comments about this? All right, now we're going to change the subject and we're going to talk about Mexico. Mexico is a little different. Remember, we talked about how Mexico was basically the jewel of the Spanish crown in America. And because of that, after Napoleon invaded Spain, the viceroy was able to maintain control in Mexico City. Right. Remember, in South America, liberal junta took control in Argentina and in New Granada, and there was fighting because of that. But in Mexico, the liberal, they did form a liberal junta, but it wasn't able to take control. Okay. The liberal in junta included criollos. One of these criollos was a man named Hidalgo. Miguel Hidalgo. Right. And Hidalgo was a priest in a town called Dolores in. In Mexico. And he was involved in this conspiracy to take over the government. Basically, what had happened in Argentina, they were trying to do in. In. In Mexico. Right. But somebody ratted him out. And so what ends up happening is a device where he sent troops to invest the members of the conspiracy. And in order to prevent that happening, Miguel Hidalgo goes to the. The town church and rings the bell and calls the peasants to rise up for freedom. This is what's known as El Grito. Right. It happened on September 14, 1810. El Grito. And that's what's celebrated as Independence Day in Mexico. Right. Even though Mexico didn't gain independence for a number of years after that. But keep in mind that the United States declared independent in 1776 and didn't become independent until 1783. Right. So Miguel Hidalgo essentially raises a rebellion, but the rebellion becomes a rebellion of indios. And it becomes, even though Miguel Hidalgo is a criollo himself, the the rebellion becomes a war between natives and indios and between essentially peninsulares and not criollos. But because peninsulares and criollos are both white, how can you tell the difference? What happens is that the criollos and the peninsulares will unite in favor or against the rebels. Right? And so the Hidalgo rebellion will be put down within about a year. But what happens is, following that, there will be other guerrilla leaders, Morelos and Guadalupe Victoria and Vicente Guerrero, who are. Who lead guerrilla movements in Mexico in the countryside. Right. So basically, if you were to look at this goes on for years. It goes on from 1810 to 1820. Right. And if you were to look at a map of Mexico in 1820, who was in control of what? The. The royalists were in control of the cities, essentially, and the rebels were in control of the countryside. Okay, you guys are with me. So. So the main rebel leaders were Victoria and Guerrero. Right. And the leader of the royalist army is a man named Augustine Iterbide. Okay, so what happens is this is Iterby day, right here in 1820, when the Constitution was restored. Iturbide says, I don't want to fight for this kingdom anymore because it's now a liberal kingdom. So he makes a deal with the leader of the opposition, Vicente Guerrero, and they make a decision to declare independence. Okay? And the independence was based on three guarantees. This is called the. Which is the army of the three guarantees. And the three guarantees are religion, independence and unity. Okay, now if you read the book, it'll tell you that, well, Catholic independence. Excuse me, Catholic. The Catholic Church will remain the official religion, which was something that the peninsulares and the conservatives demanded. There will be independence for Mexico, but it will be a constitutional monarchy. And then there's unity. Right, but the unity basically is unity between the criollos and the peninsulares. Okay, so who's left out of that? The mestizo? Anybody? That's not. You're right, Mestizo can be part of it. The criollos and the peninsulares. What? What is what? Yeah, go ahead. The mestizos and the mulattos and the natives and the Africans. Exactly. So basically everybody that's not white. Right, so the unity then is the unity of white people, essentially. And. And it's completely left out. Everybody else is completely left out. Okay. And we're going to see how that plays out a little bit next. Okay, not today. All right, so anyway, on September 27, 1821, the first Mexican empire is proclaimed. And his picture of the triumphant entry of Iturbide into Mexico City. What's interesting about this is that when they made the agreement of the three guarantees, the idea was that the constitutional monarchy, the monarch of the constitutional monarchy would be Ferdinand. But Ferdinand obviously didn't want to be monarch because he didn't give, he didn't want to give up New Spain. And so Iterbide basically says, well, if nobody else wants it, I guess I'll take it. So Iterbide then becomes the first emperor of Mexico. What's interesting about that is that a year later he'll be executed, but that's a different story. Okay, questions? Comments about any of this? Okay, so now Mexico is also independent in theory. All right, but now let's take a look at what happens. Right? Here's basically what happens in these are the years that these different countries become independent. The last country to become independent was Bolivia, right? That was actually assisted by Bolivar. Right? But what happens is that nobody can agree on what they have accomplished. So every country essentially will struggle with whether the country that they've created is going to be a liberal democracy or whether it's going to be some kind of a centralist monarchical society. Right? And the difference between these ideals is going to be the liberals are the ones who want, who are, who want to, who believe in this liberal revolution that we started talking about. Conservatives are the people who gain power and influence and money from being part of the empire and they want to keep that form of government so they can maintain the status quo, right? So these two groups of people can't agree on what kind of country is going to be established. So for example, we talked about Mexico becomes a constitutional monarchy, essentially an empire, right? But the question then becomes, among the politicians in Mexico, is it a constitutional monarchy or is it a constitutional monarchy? You guys get what I'm saying? And so they fight about it, but what happens is their disagreements end up with bloodshed. And this happens throughout the Americas. So we have liberals and conservatives fighting against each other at different times throughout the Americas for the next 50 years. In the middle of all this, there is a, a kind of an aspect of the Spanish empire. An individual called the caldillo, a caudillo is kind of like a warlord. They're usually large landowners, right? They're large landowners and they may have their own private armies, but their interest is in their own self aggrandizement, right? So one example of a Caldillo who, who disrupts politics in Spanish America is Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana. You probably have heard of Santa Ana before, right? With the Alamo and all that stuff. Right. But Santa Ana was a caudillo. He was a large landowner from San Pico. And he would be a liberal or a conservative, depending on which side he thought was winning. He served in the presidency like 11 different times, but he never. His politics were always in favor of his own self aggrandizement. So we have these three different groups of people who are fighting over control in the Americas for the next 50 years. And the outcome is going to be economic crippling, debt, basically, political instability, crippling debt. The economic output that they are able to create goes to pay off foreign debts. And then those foreign debts will also lead to foreign intervention. One example of that is the Battle of Puebla, which happened on. Was it July? It was in May. May 5, 1862. Does anybody know what we celebrate about the Battle of Puebla? A lot of people. What day was it? Cinco de Mayo. Cinco de Mayo, right. Cinco de Mayo was actually the day of the Battle of Pueblos. It's a kind of a patriotic holiday in Mexico, kind of like we do D Day here, which is not a national holiday, but we mark it right. And in the United States, it's become a national day of drinking, but it's not Mexican Independence Day. Okay, questions? Comments about this? So basically, then we see this age of democratic revolutions and with nothing but turmoil throughout the Americas, except in the United States. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments, Anything? Let's see. I'm done. Live long and prosper. All right, Professor. Have a good one, Professor. Thank you, Professor. Thank you, Professor. Adios. Take care, guys.

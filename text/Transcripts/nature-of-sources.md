## Challenging the Traditional Narrative

**If you're like many of us, your understanding of the Spanish conquest might be rooted in a somewhat simplified narrative** - perhaps that tale of a few daring Spaniards overcoming a vast native empire. **But our mission today goes far beyond that simple story.**

**We're not just extracting insights about what happened during the conquest and subsequent exploitation.** We're critically examining **how we know it happened** by looking directly at the diverse, often conflicting historical sources themselves.

**What's truly illuminating is that this isn't simply about recounting past events** - it's fundamentally about understanding **the "how" of history.** How narratives are constructed, how they're debated, and how they can shift dramatically over time.

---

## The Foundation: Understanding Historiography

### What Is Historiography?

**Historiography sounds academic, but it's a concept that truly changes how you engage with historical knowledge.** Historiography is essentially **the practice of doing history** - or more specifically, the study of historical writing itself.

**When we talk about history, we're not just talking about what happened, but the way we remember and interpret what happened.** History is produced, curated, recorded - it's not static, not carved in stone. **And that production is incredibly dynamic, constantly evolving.**

### The Columbus Day Example

**Think about Columbus Day versus Indigenous Peoples Day.** For decades, Columbus Day was celebrated, often framed as America's founding discovery. But today, in many places, that narrative has shifted dramatically toward Indigenous Peoples Day, recognizing the immense suffering and displacement brought by European arrival.

**It's not just a name change** - it reflects a deep cultural shift, a re-evaluation of values, a recontextualization of events. **If you read a history book about Columbus written in 1900, then compare it to one from 1950, then again to one from 2020, you'll find fundamentally different stories** even using the same core documents.

---

## Ontology: The Invisible Framework

### What We "Know" Without Thinking

**Ontology is what's so deeply embedded in our culture that we know things to be true without even realizing we know them.** It's fundamental, often subconscious, shaping our worldview.

**Think about social media.** A decade ago, many of us implicitly knew it was mainly for fun, connecting with friends. Now our collective ontology has shifted - **we often implicitly know it influences elections, mental health, geopolitics.** That fundamental shift in what we inherently know is an ontological change.

### The Monsieur Le Barre Story

**A powerful historical example comes from Michel-Rolph Trouillot's book "Silencing the Past."** He tells the story of Monsieur Le Barre, a French slave owner on Saint-Domingue (modern Haiti) just before the Haitian Revolution in 1791.

**Le Barre wrote a letter home to his wife assuring her they were perfectly safe from slave revolt.** He confidently stated that **slaves "can't even imagine liberty" the way white people could** - because their very nature precluded it. He wrote this as a fact, not speculation.

**But of course, his knowledge was profoundly wrong.** Not long after writing that letter, **Le Barre was killed by rebelling slaves during the opening stages of the Haitian Revolution** - a revolution born precisely from enslaved people's fierce desire for liberty.

**Le Barre's worldview was shaped by his position, his culture, the economic system, prevailing ideologies justifying slavery.** He literally couldn't conceive of slaves desiring freedom because his fundamental understanding of the world precluded it.

## Historicity 1 vs. Historicity 2

### The Baseball Game Analogy

**Think about analyzing a baseball game.** The final score - say, 3-2 - that's a fact. **But the story of the game** - how it felt, whether the referee was biased, how teams performed, why one team won - **that story will differ dramatically depending on which team's fan you ask.**

**That's history.** It operates in that ambiguous interpretive space. If you just get dates and simple outcomes, you understand nothing about the richness, contradictions, and complexity of human experience.

### Trouillot's Framework

**Historicity 1:** What happened - the actual events, the raw data, just the facts (like the baseball score)

**Historicity 2:** What is said to have happened - the interpretation, the narrative created, recorded, shared, remembered (the fan's story of the game)

**Any work of history you read is a product of the tension between these two** - the interplay between actual occurrence and the way that occurrence is understood and presented.

---

## Primary vs. Secondary Sources

### The Fundamental Distinction

**A primary source is an uninterpreted document** - direct first-hand accounts, artifacts, original records from the period. For the conquest, accounts written by soldier Bernal D√≠az or the native-authored Florentine Codex are primary sources.

**A secondary source is an interpretation of a primary source** - your history textbook, a documentary, an academic article, even an introduction written by a modern historian to an old primary document.

**Understanding this distinction is fundamental to critically evaluating any historical information.** It forces you to ask: whose interpretation? What sources are they using? What's their bias?

---

## The Conquest Sources: A Contested Story

### Accounts of the Conquistadors

**Francisco L√≥pez de G√≥mara - *Historia General de las Indias* (1552)**
- **Cort√©s's secretary who never went to the Americas**
- **Based entirely on Cort√©s's letters and personal recollections**
- **Essentially a glorified biography** defending his patron's actions
- **Valuable for understanding Cort√©s's self-perception** but far from impartial

**Bernal D√≠az del Castillo - *La Verdadera Historia de la Conquista de Nueva Espa√±a***
- **"The True Story" - quite a title**
- **Common soldier who was there, participated in nearly every campaign**
- **Wrote explicitly in response to G√≥mara** - felt common soldiers didn't get enough credit
- **But wrote in his 70s, decades after events**
- **Was an encomendero desperately wanting to keep his grant**
- **Eyewitness account but carefully constructed defense influenced by personal interests**

### Accounts of the Clergy

**Bartolom√© de las Casas - *Brev√≠sima relaci√≥n de la destrucci√≥n de las Indias***
- **"The Destruction of the Indies"**
- **Former encomendero turned fierce advocate for indigenous peoples**
- **Powerful, polemical critique of Spanish abuses**
- **Invaluable counter-narrative** but with its own agenda emphasizing moral dimensions

### Accounts of the Natives

**The Florentine Codex**
- **Compiled under Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag√∫n**
- **Written by native scholars educated by the church**
- **Incredible ethnographic resource** documenting history, culture, religion
- **But calling it "the Aztec account" would be misleading**
- **Writers were children of nobility, not present during conquest**
- **Educated by Spanish Christians** - worldview shaped by Spanish frameworks
- **Many informants were Tlaxcalans** writing about their Mexica enemies

**It's like trying to understand the full American perspective by only interviewing people from California** - both American, but different viewpoints and political leanings.

## The Quetzalcoatl Problem: When History Gets Invented

### The Popular Story

**The familiar narrative goes like this:** In ancient times, Topiltzin, an incarnation of the Nahuatl god Quetzalcoatl (the feathered serpent), was exiled and vowed to return from the east in a specific year - Ce Acatl ("One Reed") in the Mexican calendar.

**When Cort√©s arrived in 1519, that was indeed a Ce Acatl year.** So the story goes, many natives, including Emperor Montezuma, believed he was either Quetzalcoatl himself or his representative, which explains their initial welcoming posture.

**The Florentine Codex seems to support this** with passages where Montezuma supposedly welcomes Cort√©s saying "You have come, my lord. We have been waiting for you."

### The Problem

**But Bernal D√≠az's account - primary source, Spanish participant - has absolutely no mention of this divine recognition.** No mention of Montezuma thinking Cort√©s is a god.

**Here's the bombshell that historians have revealed:** **There's actually no solid evidence that this entire elaborate story predates the conquest itself.** Many historians now believe the narrative was **invented after the conquest, likely by the natives themselves.**

### Why Invent It?

**It served as a psychologically satisfying explanation for the unimaginable collapse of their vast, powerful empire.** How could the proud Mexica have been defeated by a few hundred foreigners?

**The Quetzalcoatl myth offered an answer:** "We thought he was a god and he wasn't. We got tricked by destiny." **It shifts blame away from native actions and leadership onto divine deception** - transforms devastating military defeat into something understandable within their spiritual framework.

**More coping mechanism than historical fact** - it helped post-conquest indigenous societies come to terms with overwhelming defeat.

---

## The Encomienda and Its Consequences

### The System Explained

**The word "encomienda" literally translates to "a gift" or "a trust" - sounds benevolent, almost protective.** But in practice, it was a grant from the Spanish crown giving Spanish encomenderos the right to use land and, more importantly, **control the labor of indigenous people living on that land.**

**Highly analogous to European feudalism** - lord controlled land and had rights to labor and tribute of peasants, but didn't own the land or people outright. **The purpose was clear: immediate wealth** - gold, silver, agricultural products.

### The Problems

**The forced labor was often wildly unproductive from the Spanish perspective.** Native populations, particularly in the Caribbean, weren't accustomed to intensive, large-scale plantation work or grueling mining labor. **Their traditional practices were communal, tied to subsistence, spiritually connected to land** - not geared toward surplus commodity production for export.

**Even worse than inefficiency was the massive population decline** - European diseases swept through with horrifying speed and lethality. **Some estimates suggest up to 90% population reduction in many areas within the first century.**

### Conquistador Motivations

**These weren't men who came to settle down and become farmers.** Spanish were primarily urban culture that valued social status and inherited privilege. **They sought immediate wealth with the singular goal of taking it back to Spain** to live like hidalgos - the lower nobility, literally "sons of something."

**This desperate desire for quick wealth, combined with rapidly diminishing labor force due to disease, created a brutal system** - encomenderos frantically exploiting natives before they died.

## The Valladolid Debate: First Human Rights Discussion

### The Opposing Arguments

**Bartolom√© de las Casas argued:**
- **Moral imperative:** Exploitation was offense against God and natural law
- **Practical concern:** Indians were dying off, undermining Spain's colonial enterprise
- **Natives were rational human beings** possessing souls and reason who deserved protection

**Juan Gin√©s de Sep√∫lveda countered:**
- **Drawing on Aristotelian philosophy:** Natives were not fully human in European sense
- **Placed them on lower tier of humanity** with white Europeans at the top
- **Natural slaves meant to be ruled by the more civilized**
- **Forced labor was the price for education and civilization** - framed as favor to indigenous people

### The Outcome and Unintended Consequences

**The king sided with Las Casas** - decreed Indians were rational human beings deserving royal protection. The **New Laws of the Indies (1542)** outlawed the encomienda system and aimed to protect native lands.

**A victory for human rights, but with devastating unintended consequences:** The Spanish Crown still desperately needed labor for silver mines and sugar plantations. **If they couldn't exploit native labor to the same extent, where would they get it?**

**The answer was Africa.** This decision directly prompted the massive escalation of the transatlantic slave trade. **Over the next centuries, as many as 15 million slaves were forcibly transported** to fill that labor void.

**A seemingly well-intentioned policy unleashed a catastrophe of unprecedented scale** - a stark example of how historical decisions can have unforeseen, devastating ripple effects.

## The Method: How Historians Work

### Cross-Referencing and Corroboration

**None of these sources are trustworthy in the way we might think of perfectly objective records.** They all come with significant baggage, personal agendas, ontological frameworks.

**The method historians use is painstaking cross-referencing.** We look for statements supported by multiple, diverse sources with different biases. **If multiple sources corroborate a detail, it's more likely to have actually happened.**

**But we must always acknowledge and critically analyze the biases in each source:** Who wrote this? Why? For whom? What did they gain or lose?

### Our Own Biases

**Our current ontological outlook - our ingrained beliefs like rooting for the underdog or favoring certain political narratives - will inevitably influence how we interpret sources.**

**It's a constant act of critical self-awareness,** a demanding dance between empathy for the past and modern moral judgment. **It's about building comprehensive, nuanced understanding, not expecting single simplistic truth.**

---

## Modern Applications: Information Literacy

### The Framework for Today

**Understanding historiography, ontology, and source analysis equips you to be a much more discerning, critical consumer of any information.** This applies far beyond history:

**When evaluating any information source, ask:**
- Who created this and why?
- What sources are they using?
- What biases might be shaping their account?
- What ontological assumptions am I bringing to this?
- How might my own worldview be influencing my interpretation?

### Historical Narratives in Real Time

**Just as Columbus Day evolved into Indigenous Peoples Day, we're constantly witnessing the creation and evolution of historical narratives in real time.** Current events become history, shaped by the same forces we've examined.

**What assumptions do you hold that might be influencing your perception of today's events?** What might future historians say about how we understood our own present moment?

---

## Key Takeaways

### History as Conversation

**History isn't a collection of inert, objective facts to memorize** - it's a dynamic, ongoing conversation about what happened and what is said to have happened. **It's a constant process of interpretation, reevaluation, understanding the human element embedded in every record.**

### The Power of Critical Thinking

**Realizing these layers of interpretation, purpose, even invention behind seemingly factual accounts is truly empowering.** It equips you to navigate information in any field, in any time.

### Pattern Recognition

**The same forces that shaped how we understand the conquest continue operating today:**
- How do power structures influence what gets recorded?
- Whose voices get heard and whose get silenced?
- How do present concerns shape our understanding of past events?
- What role do competing narratives play in identity formation?

## Reflection Questions

*Use these questions to demonstrate your understanding of historical source analysis and its modern applications:*

1. **Source Bias Analysis**: Compare the motivations behind G√≥mara's *Historia General de las Indias* (written by Cort√©s's secretary who never went to the Americas) and Bernal D√≠az's *La Verdadera Historia* (written by an aging conquistador defending his encomienda). How do their different positions and purposes shape their accounts of the same events? What can we learn from sources even when we know they're biased?

2. **The Quetzalcoatl Problem**: The lesson argues that the story of Montezuma welcoming Cort√©s as the returning god Quetzalcoatl was likely invented after the conquest to explain the Mexica's defeat. Analyze this as an example of "Historicity 2" (what is said to have happened) potentially overriding "Historicity 1" (what actually happened). Why might post-conquest indigenous communities create this narrative? What does this reveal about how societies cope with trauma?

3. **Ontological Awareness**: The lesson uses Monsieur Le Barre's inability to conceive of slaves desiring freedom as an example of how ontology shapes perception. Identify a current belief or assumption that seems self-evident to you about how the world works. How might this "ontological outlook" be influencing your understanding of contemporary events? What would someone from a different cultural background or time period think about this assumption?

4. **Unintended Consequences**: Las Casas's successful argument for protecting indigenous peoples led to the massive escalation of the African slave trade. Analyze this as an example of how well-intentioned policies can have devastating unforeseen effects. Can you identify a modern example where solving one problem created or worsened another? How should we account for such historical complexity when making moral judgments about past actions?

5. **Information Literacy**: Apply the historiographical framework from this lesson to a current news story or political debate. Identify the different "sources" involved (primary participants, journalists, analysts, social media commentators). How do their different positions, motivations, and audiences shape their accounts? What ontological assumptions might you be bringing to your interpretation? How might this same event be understood differently by people with different worldviews?

---

## The Ongoing Conversation

**History demands nuance - it's not simply black and white facts.** Understanding the nature of sources, the biases within them, and the dynamic human element behind every recorded event is a powerful tool for navigating information in any field, in any time.

**As you move forward, consider how your own ontological outlook might be shaping your understanding of today's events,** just as it shaped how historical events were recorded and interpreted in the past.

**Keep asking those questions** - because understanding how we know what we know is ultimately more important than memorizing what we think we know.

---

*"We hope this deep dive has encouraged your continued curiosity, not just about what happened in history, but about the profound 'why' and 'how' of historical narratives. History isn't just memorizing dates and names - it's understanding the forces at play, the different perspectives, and how the story itself gets told."*

# Glossary: The Nature of Sources
*Key terms for understanding historical methodology and source analysis*

---

## **Conquistador**
Spanish explorers and soldiers who conquered parts of the Americas in the 16th century. Examples include Hern√°n Cort√©s (who conquered the Aztec Empire) and Francisco Pizarro (who conquered the Inca Empire).

## **Encomienda**
A Spanish colonial system that granted colonists the right to demand tribute and forced labor from indigenous people living on specific lands. While presented as a "trust" or "gift," it was essentially a form of legalized exploitation similar to European feudalism.

## **Encomendero**
A Spanish colonist who received an encomienda grant, giving them control over indigenous labor and tribute on specific lands.

## **Hidalgo**
Spanish minor nobility, literally meaning "son of something." Many conquistadors hoped to use their wealth from the Americas to achieve this social status back in Spain.

## **Historicity 1**
What actually happened - the raw facts and events of history without interpretation (like the final score of a baseball game).

## **Historicity 2**
What is said to have happened - how events are interpreted, recorded, and remembered by different people (like how different fans describe the same baseball game).

## **Historiography**
The study of how history is written and interpreted. It examines not just what happened, but how different historians and sources have understood and presented those events over time.

## **Indigenous Peoples**
The original inhabitants of a region before colonization. In the Americas, this includes groups like the Aztecs (Mexica), Maya, Inca, and hundreds of other distinct cultures and societies.

## **Mexica**
The people commonly called "Aztecs" - they called themselves Mexica and built a powerful empire centered in what is now Mexico City (then called Tenochtitlan).

## **Montezuma (Moctezuma)**
The Mexica emperor when Cort√©s arrived in 1519. His initial response to the Spanish conquistadors remains a subject of historical debate.

## **Nahuatl**
The language spoken by the Mexica and many other indigenous groups in central Mexico. Many Nahuatl words (like chocolate, tomato, and coyote) entered English through Spanish.

## **New Laws of the Indies (1542)**
Spanish laws that attempted to protect indigenous peoples by outlawing the encomienda system and establishing that natives were rational human beings deserving of protection.

## **Ontology**
The fundamental beliefs and assumptions about reality that are so deeply embedded in a culture that people accept them without question. These shape how people understand the world around them.

## **Primary Source**
An original document, artifact, or account created during the time period being studied, by someone who directly witnessed or participated in the events. Examples include letters, diaries, government records, or eyewitness accounts.

## **Quetzalcoatl**
A Nahuatl deity known as the "feathered serpent." The story that Montezuma mistook Cort√©s for this returning god is now questioned by many historians as possibly being invented after the conquest.

## **Secondary Source**
A document created by someone who did not directly witness the events, often interpreting or analyzing primary sources. Examples include textbooks, documentaries, or modern historical analyses.

## **Saint-Domingue**
The French colonial name for the western part of the island of Hispaniola (now Haiti). It was the site of the successful Haitian Revolution (1791-1804), the first successful slave revolt in the Americas.

## **Tenochtitlan**
The magnificent capital city of the Mexica Empire, built on an island in Lake Texcoco. The Spanish destroyed it and built Mexico City on its ruins.

## **Tlaxcalans**
Indigenous people who were enemies of the Mexica Empire and became crucial allies to the Spanish conquistadors. Many accounts of the conquest come from Tlaxcalan perspectives, which must be considered when evaluating sources.

## **Transatlantic Slave Trade**
The forced transportation of an estimated 12-15 million Africans to the Americas between the 16th and 19th centuries. This system intensified after Spanish restrictions on indigenous labor.

## **Valladolid Debate (1550-1551)**
A formal debate in Spain between Bartolom√© de las Casas (arguing for indigenous rights) and Juan Gin√©s de Sep√∫lveda (arguing that indigenous people were "natural slaves"). Often considered one of the first formal human rights debates in Western history.

---

## **Key Historical Figures**

### **Bartolom√© de las Casas (1484-1566)**
A Spanish priest and former encomendero who became a fierce advocate for indigenous rights. His writings, especially "A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies," documented Spanish abuses and influenced the New Laws of the Indies.

### **Bernal D√≠az del Castillo (1492-1584)**
A Spanish conquistador who participated in the conquest of Mexico and later wrote "The True History of the Conquest of New Spain." His account provides a soldier's perspective, written decades later to counter other versions of events.

### **Hern√°n Cort√©s (1485-1547)**
The Spanish conquistador who led the expedition that conquered the Mexica Empire. His letters to the Spanish king provide his own version of events, though they must be read critically as self-serving accounts.

### **Francisco L√≥pez de G√≥mara (1511-1566)**
Cort√©s's secretary who wrote "General History of the Indies" without ever visiting the Americas. His account, based entirely on Cort√©s's stories, presents a very favorable view of his patron.

### **Juan Gin√©s de Sep√∫lveda (1494-1573)**
A Spanish philosopher who argued during the Valladolid Debate that indigenous peoples were "natural slaves" according to Aristotelian philosophy and therefore justified targets for conquest and forced labor.

### **Bernardino de Sahag√∫n (1499-1590)**
A Franciscan friar who supervised the creation of the Florentine Codex, working with indigenous scholars to document Nahuatl culture, history, and perspectives on the conquest.

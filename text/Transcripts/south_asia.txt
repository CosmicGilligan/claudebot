Good afternoon. Can you guys hear me? Bobby, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. I can't hear you. You guys like my song? I enjoyed it. You know why I played that song today? No, why? Middle Lakes in India today. Yeah, we're going to talk about India and we're going to talk about a lot of places today. How are you guys doing? Any questions or comments that I can help you with? So we're going to do the usual ritual for starting off by saying, would you please turn on your cameras? Some of you will, I guess, but I really would appreciate it if you did. Are there any questions about anything so far? Anything about. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Just the quiz. Are we doing that today in class or is that just. I know it says 1159, but it. No, we're not doing it in class. It's. It's available to you tonight. Let me just show you on our little website here. I'm glad you asked the question, actually. Okay, so here's our webpage. And then this was last week's exam, right. And it's due tonight. All right. By the end of today, about half of you, I think we've done it. And then we have another one for this week's readings that will be due next Thursday. Okay, you guys are following me here. Questions, comments. So. Okay, so does that answer your question? Yes, it does. I couldn't see you there for a minute because I had to make sure. Okay, well, so now looking at here, just to let you know what's coming up today, we're going to talk about South Asia, which is an enormous area for a long period of time, but that will kind of end our tour of the world in 1500. And we're going to start looking at Europe next week, and we'll spend the next two or three weeks after that studying just Europe. Okay, The. So. So today I'm going to show you. In fact, I've already shown. I've already got the. This is the slide set for today's lecture. And then there's a couple of things that are going to be due coming up. All right. One of them is there's a document here. There's a chapter out of a book on World War I that talks about the Ottoman Empire in 1914. But we're gonna. I'll introduce this to you in a few minutes. But this is pretty short document, but I'd like for you to read that and answer a few questions from here in here. And then a week from Tuesday, we will be discussing A document. I didn't put the document up. That's the problem. Okay. I have to put the document up. I thought I did. Anyway, there's going to be a document here, and I want you to read it. This is going to be about the meeting between Cortez and Montezuma and different accounts of it, and we're going to talk about that again a week from Tuesday. All right, so that's something that you can see coming up. It's about 30, 40 pages, something like that. So it's a little bit longer than the normal one. All right, any questions, comments about what's going on? This will be put on the module or assignments. Yeah, I'm going to put the document up. I just forgot to do it. But it's ready. I finished it like 15 minutes ago. Just like you guys when you turn your homework in. Right. Okay. So any other questions about anything that's coming up? So again, just keep your eyes open. Also remember that the discussion is due tonight. Okay. And everybody has to discuss. I mean, that's, that's part of the, the course. If you don't do the discussion, you can't get any credit for, for watching the movie. So. So I'd like for you to do that, and hopefully that's. That's turning into a learning experience for you guys. Any questions? Comments? Let me go ahead and. And look at the. Let's go ahead and start with the lecture. And so where is that? Oh, okay. So. So we're going to talk about three empires. Let me just show you. I thought I had a. Oh, darn. I thought I had a map of the three empires that we're going to be looking at. I don't, but basically, let's see if I can. That's not a good one. Let's see. Maybe this one. Yeah, so this, this kind of helps us a little bit here if you look at this map, because this one is the one that's in the middle. The Ottoman Empire is going to be an Islamic empire in Europe and the Middle east and North Africa. The Safavid Empire is another Islamic empire in what's today Iran. And the Mughal Empire will at one point occupy most of what we call today India and Pakistan. Okay, so, so, so those are the three empires that we're going to be looking at. We're again, talking about the period right at the end of the European Middle Ages. And one of the things that hopefully you guys will see by today's presentation is that these empires were incredibly powerful and incredibly wealthy, and that's one of the reasons why, when we think about, when we start to look at Europe next week, we're going to realize how far behind and poor Europe was compared to the rest of the world. That's one of the reasons why we're looking at this. It's also, as we're going to see, there are some of the things that happen even going back this far are going to have consequences today. Okay, any questions or comments before we go? All right, so let's start with the Mughal Empire. This is exactly the opposite of the way your book does it, but it doesn't matter. It's just. This doesn't work. I haven't done a good job with this. Anyway, let's take a look here. Okay, so the Mughal Empire was a successor state to the Mongols. You guys will remember when we looked at, when we looked at the Mongol Empire a couple weeks ago, it actually encompassed almost all of Asia and about half of Europe. Okay. And it was essentially had taken over the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. But now, here's the thing we need to understand about India, because we think today of India as a country. And in a few weeks, we're going to be looking at the independence of India from the British Empire. And one of the things that one of the kind of dramas of that period was how the people of India, the Indian National Congress, the leaders of India, tried to create a united India, the Indian state that we know of today. The problem with that is it's ahistorical that there isn't. There has never been an India. What there has been is 6,000 little areas, okay? And sometimes these areas were united under larger empires and sometimes not. But what that means then is that there's 6,000 different dialects, there's 6,000 different political structures, there's 6,000 different identities. And so when we think about then unifying India, what we really mean during this period of time during the Mughal Empire is that there was that one man essentially ruled all of this area. But there was never any sense that this was a single nation the way we would think of a nation today. And one of the things that we'll actually look at when we do our. When we go through the course and really starting in a couple weeks is going to be, how do we even come up with our idea of a nation state? Because in Europe at this time, there were no nation states either, right? There were just like this. There were a bunch of little area, little political areas with different dialects and things like that. And it was a product of what we call the Enlightenment, that we started to think in terms of a nation state, which is an area that's occupied by people that have something in common. Okay. Like they all speak French or they all speak English or something like that. Right. So. So that's. That's kind of a modern way of thinking about areas, and we have to kind of get out of. Break out of that mold and able to be able to understand all of these different places that we're talking about today. Any questions? Comments? Feel good? Professor Cox? Yes. Not. You're not presenting anything, if that's what you're trying to do. I'm sorry. You're not presenting in what's on your screen. I'm not so. Well, I'm glad you told me that. I'm so sorry. Let's see. How do we do this? This is. Okay, now am I presenting now? Do you guys see it? Oh, hold on a second. I gotta do something else here, because otherwise you can't see me. And, you know, the only reason why I need to see you so that you guys are, like, sticking your tongue out at me or something. I see it, but I guess if you're gonna do that, you turn your camera off. At any rate, sorry about that, guys. Thanks for letting me know that. Okay, so this is the map that I was talking about. And so when we talk about the Mughal empire, the Mughals were actually people that come from. To what we call today Afghanistan. And one of the interesting things about Afghanistan is that it has. It was. It's been under Islamic rule since the right act, not too long after the. The rise of Islam as a state in the Arab empire, but it has never been under the. Under the domination of any other empire. Okay. There are people who claim to rule it from time to time, but it's always been a very tribal area like it is today. And it has. Rather than being the subject of an empire, it's the source of many empires, and it's really the source of all three of the empires that we're going to be looking at today. Because there was a group of people who lived in Afghanistan, and that's right up here. Right? There were a group of people who lived in Afghanistan who would take over areas, the areas that become the three empires that we're talking about today. Then they're called Turks. Turks. All right, so when we think about Turks, we think about Turkey, and Turkey is the peninsula of Anatolia in the Middle east, where Turkey is today. But the Turks actually come from Central Asia. All right, questions? Comments about this. So it was the Turks. There was a man named Babur. I guess that's how you pronounce it. I've never. I don't speak Mughal. Right. But there were. There was a man named a leader, a kind of a tribal leader in the. In what we would call Afghanistan today, who conquered this area here, Delhi, which was a sultanate at the time, and established the Mughal dynasty. So the Mughal dynasty will rule over an expanding empire until the 18th century. Okay. And so some of the major leaders of the Mughal empire was Akbar here. One of the interesting things about Akbar and also one of the interesting things about India is that India is. Is the geographical location of a number of different religious traditions. Okay? So. So if there's. There are kind of the. The native tradition would be called Hinduism, Hindus and Hindus. There's a large. A large Hindu population in India. And that's. It's probably most native tradition. And then associated with that are two other traditions. The Sikhs, who are mostly in northern India, and the Buddhists. Actually, Buddhists came from northern India as well. Okay. So those are kind of the traditional religions of the Indian subcontinent. And then introduction of Islam. Islam. A number. A large number of Indian people will convert to Islam. Okay? And. And so what we have then is a mix of all these different religions. And. And one of the things that was characteristic of particularly Islam and Christianity were that they were essentially intolerant, okay? Meaning that there. A number of people thought that everybody that lived in this area should be followers of Muhammad. Now, there were varying levels of toleration. There were places in that were ruled by Muslim rulers who. All of these guys were Muslim rulers who would allow people to practice their own religion and still protect them. But in order to get that protection, they had to pay a special tax. Right? But what Akbar did was he tried to create a state where all of the religions were considered equal. And one of the outcomes of that is that it brings a harmony to his empire. There's not a lot of religious infighting. Okay? And that doesn't mean that people that are Hindus don't think that the Muslims are all wrong. And it doesn't think that the Muslims think that the Hindus are all. Or, excuse me. All right. Or all wrong. Right. It just means that. It just means that they're not fighting about it. Okay? And that's very much like the way that we do it here, I think, in the United States. And that's an outcome of the European enlightenment, except that the. Unlike in the United States, there is. And there was an official religion and that was Islam. Okay. And one thing that we want to notice here is that Islam, the basis of Islam, like Judaism and like Christianity, is that there is a single God. It's monotheistic. Right. And the, the. By contrast, Hinduism has any number of gods. I'm not even. I don't even know how many gods there are. There may be as many gods as there are Hindus. Right. And that creates a kind of an intractable situation in the Indian subcontinent because you have a number of people who insist that there's only one God. And then you have another number of people who insist that God, there's many gods. And when you get past the point where you are tolerant of each other, then it becomes a basis for, for, for conflict. And one of the things that we'll notice later when we study India under British rule is that that conflict between Muslims and Hindus is, is very much alive during that period of British rule. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. Okay, so now I'm just going to talk about. We talked about Akbar. He was religious intolerant. Probably the most famous of the rulers was this guy here, Shah Jahan. You may or may not have heard of him, but he is the one who commissioned the Taj Mahal. This is a picture of the Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal is a. It's a Muslim. It's a. It's a tomb for his beloved wife. And so what I'd like to do right now is I want to show you guys a little short video clip that will give you some idea of the. The atmosphere, the culture and the atmosphere of. Of the Islamic, of the Mughal empire. So just give me a minute here and I'll get it started up if I can find it here. You guys, you guys see no old Indian guy there? You have to say something, yes or no? I see. Can you guys see an old Indian guy there? Yeah. Okay. Yes. In the year 1631, the King and his family traveled to one of his many residences, the fort of Burhanpur. Fountains flowed and soft breezes blew in from the river. Their journey had been long and arduous, for they carried with them a priceless treasure. Mumtaz Mahal was pregnant. Soon to give birth. The queen and the women of the harem bathed in cool marble pools, out of sight of the world. The talk was only of the new child, a child whose destiny was to live in a world of wealth and power unimaginable to ordinary people. Shah Jahan was the sun and center of the shining world of the Mughal Court. And he lived a life of unrivalled splendor. Around him swirled an ocean of courtiers, artists and politicians, scholars and schemers, musicians and Mogul dignitaries. The Emperor and his family lived lives of ritual, ceremony and spectacular celebration. But the greatest kings and queens are still subject to the hand of fate. Mumtaz and Shah Jahan had known great joy and sorrow. More precious to them than and any treasures were their beautiful children. Mumtaz had borne him 13 sons and daughters, but seven had died in infancy. Despite their heartbreak, she remained forever at his side. For the man, she was his strength in sadness. To the king, she was the noble queen. And now, on that June day in Burhanpur, she told him that the birth of their latest child is very close. Truly, he was the king who had all his heart desired. Shah Jahan was powerful and wealthy beyond the dreams of other kings. King Charles I of England struggled to maintain his court on a budget of half a million pounds. Shah Jahan's annual income was over 20 million. No expense was spared in creating a court of unrivalled opulence. The finest artisans created the most lavish items to fill the royal chambers. His treasury overflowed with the amassed wealth of all his conquered territories. And to secure his reputation forever, he commissioned the ultimate royal status symbol, the Peacock Throne. The imperial goldsmiths were instructed to take treasure, hoard it for generations and construct the most lavish throne the world had ever seen. Seven years in the making, the throne contained 2,600 pounds of solid gold. Nine million rupees worth of gems were set into the throne, including the Kohinoor diamond. No one who saw it would doubt his strength and power. This was Shah Jahan, king of the world, the man who had everything. Yeah. What did you guys think? What did you guys think of that? Interesting. What was interesting about. Did you think it was interesting that like the. The guy was just born into power? Huh? That happens a lot during this period of time. And then how he was making 20 million, like every day, not every day, but every year, it just shows. It just really shows the, the contrast. Because when we think about King Charles the First, who was his contemporary, King Charles the First was the king of England. And England was one of the major powers of Europe at that time, the ascended power in Europe. And so you can see the kind of the difference in the power balance between Europe and Asia at this time. What else did you guys see? Anything else in there that was interesting to you? Let me tell you the story about the woman, Montez Mahan. When she had the baby that was being talked about during the video. She died in childbirth and the king was devastated. But he then set out on a 20 year project to build the Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal is the tomb of Mahal. Okay, any questions, comments about that? All right, well, moving on. Then his son, actually he had two sons and one of them, I can't remember the name right off top of my head, but he was the one who was had, was the chosen heir. But his brother rebelled against him and he took control of the empire. And the major change that he made in the empire was that he reversed the religious toleration that had been established by Akbar. And the result was that there was a renewal of religious unrest, religious conflict between particularly between Hindus and Muslims. And that is going to continue until the end of the empire. It actually is part of the reason why the empire, the empire declines. The other reason though is going to be because by the time we get to the 18th century, which is about. Well, actually it's not that long. It's pretty, it's essentially during the reign of the Europeans will start to be trading along the coast of India. And eventually what will happen is that Europeans will ally themselves with the local rulers and then eventually they will come to control those areas. So by the time we get to the middle of the 19th century, much of the Indian subcontinent is ruled by private corporations in Europe until they rebel and then the British actually send troops and conquer what becomes known later as India. And that's a story that we'll have to finish a little bit later. Okay, questions, Comments about this? All right, so we're going to move a little bit further to the west now. We're going to talk about the Safavid Empire. I already showed you this, this map. And the Safavid Empire was founded by again, Turks from the area of Afghanistan. What's really significant about the Safavid Empire is that the rulers of the Safavid Empire were the proponents of a schism in Islam. Okay, so let me just talk briefly about the history of Islam. And that is that Islam was founded by Muhammad in the 8th century. And then when, when Muhammad died, then there were, then he was replaced by somebody else from his household. But there was a controversy because many people believe that the person who replaced Muhammad as the leader of the Muslim community wasn't the right guy. He was illegitimate. And that should have been somebody else. And, and so these people who, who follow this other person, who they, who many people think should have been or was the leader of the Community, followers of Ali become what's known as Shiites eventually. Okay? And I don't know if you guys are. How familiar you guys are with the Middle east, right? But you. But if you know very much about it at all, you know that. That Iran, which was Persia, which was the Safavid empire, is the center of Shiism in the Islamic world. Okay? Shiism is one kind of branch of. Of. Of Islam, and the other branch is called Sunni. There's many other different groups of them, but the other major group is the Sunnis. And the Sunnis believe then that the succession of Muhammad was as it should have been. And so they follow. They believe that whoever is the caliph now of the Islamic world is the true successor of Muhammad. Where. Whereas Shiites believe that after the 12th ruler, the. The. The. The. The real ruler went into hiding, and the real ruler is now actually in hiding and they're waiting for him to come back. Right? And that's called 12. 12. Shiism. Twelver Shiism, I think. Let me make sure that that's right, because again, I'm not really an Islamic scholar, but that 12 were Shiism. Right? And so what that does is it creates. There's. There is. There is a fundamental rivalry between Shiites and Sunnis. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about any of this so far? Oh, are you sharing your screen? Am I not sharing my screen again? I'm so sorry. Jesus. You guys have to speak up. Okay, I think we're good now. Can you see? Oh, that's not. No, no, that's not what I wanted. This one. Okay, you see this? The south of the empire now. Oh, okay. All right. So this was the map I was looking at. This is where the Turks came from. And then the rest of it, I was just talking about Islam. But the point that I made, the point that I come to, is that there is a rivalry between Shiites and Sunnis, which is maybe even deeper than the rivalry in Christianity between Protestants and Catholics or between Eastern Orthodox and Catholics or Western Christians. You guys get what I'm saying here? Does that make sense? And you will remember that right now, Protestants and Catholics aren't fighting it out anymore most of the time. And the Eastern Orthodox religions and the rest of the Christianity aren't really fighting it out anymore either. Right? But one thing that you may or may not know is that after the Iranian revolution, which happened in the 70s, which you guys maybe have heard about the Iranian. The hostage crisis in Iran during the Carter administration and how the hostages were freed after the Iranian Revolution and Ayatollah Khomeini and all that other stuff right after they took control. And there was a man named Saddam Hussein who was in control of another area next to Iran called Iraq. I'm sure you've heard of that. Iraq. The Iranians actually fought a war, a very bloody and long war against Iraq over the issue of Sunni versus Shiite. Okay? So when that war had only recently ended, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and then the United States got involved in Iraq. Okay, you guys following here, questions, comments? So now here's another thing we're going to be looking, as I mentioned, I mean, all these things we're going to come back to during the 20th century. But the thing that we need to look at right now is that if you look at this map and this map is accurate to a certain degree, right, you will see all the countries that we know of today, Turkey and Russia and Greece or Ukraine here and the Iran and Arabia. But do you see Iraq anywhere in there? Do you know why you don't see Iraq in there? Because there isn't any Iraq, okay? Iraq is an invention of the Treaty of Versailles. And up until the time of 1914, Iraq was under the control of the Ottoman Empire and the Ottoman rule over the area that's now Iraq was an area that was. It was actually three different areas with three different groups living there, the Kurds, the Shiites and the Sunnis who didn't get along. And so under the Ottoman Empire, they were not. There was no attempt in any way to unite them. But after 1914, the Western powers redrew the map and created the nation of Iraq. So Iraq did not exist until 1923. You guys follow me here. You guys get what I'm saying? Okay, so now here's what's interesting about that, and again, we'll be looking at this from the other side a little bit later, is that if there has never been a nation of Iraq, remember I told you there was never a nation of India, Right? If there has never been a nation of Iraq, why did the United States think they needed to send troops to liberate it? You guys follow? I'm saying here, we're going to keep that in mind. That's a question I want you to think about as we go through, as we go through the rest of the course, okay? Questions, comments about any of this. Okay? So now again, it goes into decline because first off, it's not united in any way. It's a bunch of different little areas, a bunch of different little chieftains and sheikhs and things like that who are all fighting against each other. And they're always under pressure from the Ottomans and then later from the Russians. Right. And as time goes by, and this is true pretty much in every empire, the quality of the rulers declines until it's eventually, you know, what really happens, I think, is that the rulers end up with so much money, they're no longer interested in ruling. All they want to do is have fun. Right? And so they become incompetent, and that leads to rebellions, internal strife, and it leaves them open to stress from outsiders. Okay? And then one of the things that will happen, one of the ways that this air, this empire became so rich was by trade in the Indian Ocean. And I'm pretty sure I already mentioned to you guys a couple weeks ago that trade in the East Indian Ocean is going to become dominated by Europeans. And when Europeans came to dominate that trade, they essentially cut off the Safavid Empire from trading with the rest of the world. And that's going to be one of the things that causes it to disintegrate. So by the time we get to the 18th century, it no longer exists. All right, questions? Comments about this? Okay, so the last one we're going to look at then is the Ottomans. The Ottomans are called Ottomans not because they have little footrests, but because the guy who founded the empire was Osman. And so somehow or other that becomes Ottoman. But at any rate, he was another the Osman. Turks came from, again from this area and they started to move into Europe and into this is Anatolia, or where Turkey is today. What we need to keep in mind is that this area here, this actually the city here, Istanbul, at the beginning of the Ottoman Empire wasn't called Istanbul. It was called Constantinople, which means the city of Constantine. And it was really the last vestige of the Roman Empire. Okay, so we see then that this whole area at one point had been controlled by the Byzantine Empire or the Eastern Roman Empire. It calls Byzantine because the earlier name for Constantinople had been Byzantium. So they call it the Byzantine Empire. Right. But at any rate, the point here is that this area was all controlled by the Christian Empire, but it had been stressed by the expansion of the Islamic Empire, and it had been stressed by the. The Mongol Empire. And now it becomes stressed by these Ottoman Turks. And eventually what happens is that the Ottoman Turks are able to take control of all that was once the Byzantine Empire. And it will, in the year 1543, it will capture Istanbul, actually Constantinople, which they rename Istanbul. And that's going to be the final end of the Roman Empire. The final end of The Roman Empire, 1453, when it's conquered by Mehmet the Conqueror and the last of the Roman emperors, Emperor John is beheaded in his head, put on a pike at the beginning, at the entrance of the city. All right, so, so basically then, the Ottoman Turks begin from their base here and they will eventually expand into all of this area that you see with the lighter color. So it was enormous. It was an enormous empire. Right. And again, it's a Muslim empire. And what they were able to do is they were taking. Were able to take control of the holy cities of Islam. So this makes the prestige of the Islamic empire, of the Ottoman Empire paramount in the Islamic world. Because whoever is the ruler of the Islamic of the Ottoman Empire is also considered to be the caliph of the Muslim holy place or the, of the Islamic world, essentially. Right. Which is why I don't know if you ever noticed this, but every king calls himself king of the world. Right. But the king of the Ottoman Empire also called himself king of the world. But that's the reason why. Okay, questions? Comments about any of that? Okay, I have a question. Oh, yeah, go ahead. Sorry. So like most of the nomadic tribes were like Alps, right? I'm sorry, they were outs. Alps, Like a L, P S. Alps. No, these nomadic tribes were actually Turks. Oh, okay. It's because I watched the like, series on like seven season series about like Alps and like how they were like Turkish and they conquered most of like. Well, actually many years earlier than this. We're going back to now the third and fourth century. There was what was known as the barbarian migrations, which was numbers of different people coming out of the. Out of Central Asia and East Asia into Europe. Okay. And so that is more than likely what you're thinking about. They were the ones that eventually brought about the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Okay, does that answer your question? Yeah, I was just a bit confused because like in the, in the series I was watching, they were like constantly migrating and like always like on the move. Right, that would been that. But did you, did you actually notice the time period that that was taking place? I did, but I watched it like probably about like six years ago. This just kind of like resurfaced from watching this all. Okay, well, so. So I think, and I could be wrong and you can check on it if you like, but I think it's. You're probably talking about that era of the barbarian migrations, right? Barbarian migrations happened at a time when Europe was essentially. I mean, it was settled by a bunch of different tribes, but it wasn't. It wouldn't be what we would consider civilized. Right. There were. It was just a bunch of different warrior tribes and warrior groups, like Vikings, for example, things like that. Right. Does that make sense? And so, yeah, when all these people from the east migrated into Europe, they end up taking over parts of Europe. But mostly what they do is, is they end up with mixing with everybody that's in Europe. So, so that's why today, when you look back and you say, okay, well, you know, I'm 100% Irish or I'm 100% French, or I'm 100% German, that's impossible because there aren't any. Everybody's mixed. Right. That's kind of a little bit of off your topic, but I think that that's the era that you're talking about during that period of time. Yeah. And there are also, like, a lot of crusaders. Well, that would have been in the 13th century. Yeah. Okay. All right, so any other questions? That's a great question. I appreciate it. Any other questions about this so far? Okay, so now the rate that the, the, the, the ruler of the Ottoman Empire at the height of the Empire, which is the. Right. At the beginning of the time period that we're talking about. So, so next week when we start looking at Europe, we'll be looking at the, the 1400s and the 1500s. Right. And the ruler of the Ottoman Empire at that point, which was this extent. Right. Was Suleiman the Magnificent. Okay. And he's actually going to be in a rivalry with the King of Spain was also the only Roman Emperor. We'll talk more about that later. Right. He's actually going to be stopped in his advance by King Philip II of Spain. And then after Suleiman ruled, the Ottoman Empire became weaker and weaker. Okay. And this is where we're, we're talking about that, that assignment that I, that I made for you guys. Let me see if I can show it to you here. Do you see. What do you guys see right now? The module, the canvas module. Okay. All right, so now you look down here. There's, as I mentioned to you before, there's a, There's a chapter of a book that's actually about World War I, right. And it talks about the Ottomans. Okay. And it's a really good background, I think. And it starts with, you know, Osman, and it moves down to 1914. But what it really shows is the decline of the Ottoman Empire. Okay, so what I'd like for you to do is. It's a pretty short, easy read. What I'd like for you to do is to go ahead and read it. And then there's a few questions that I asked. It tells us not only about the Ottoman Empire, but it also tells us about the importance of looking at things that maybe happened a thousand years ago. How does that affect us? You know what I mean? But it actually does. And that's. This is going to be a way of seeing how that works, making that connection. Okay. Does that make sense to you guys? So one of the interesting things, I guess, about the Ottoman Empire is it will last until 1923. It is dismembered after World War I by the treaty of Versailles. But about the century before World War I, it had declined. It didn't control all these areas anymore. Many of these areas were now controlled by Europeans. Right. And there was a big kind of nationalist movement happening here in southeastern Europe. And the Russians were pressuring, and the Ottomans. We're having difficulty modernizing. Do you remember me talking about modernization last week? Yeah. About China. Right. And what did I say? What did I say about modernization? What is the challenge of modernization in the 19th century? It's like abandoning your culture kind of. Or complacent. It could be. But what. What happens if you don't modernize? You're left behind by the rest of the world that does modernize. So I gave you the challenge. This is kind of. You probably want to quote this. So the challenge of modernization is modernize or be colonized. Colonized. Oh, yeah, right. China could not modernize. So it was colonized. Japan did modernize, and it was not colonized, but it became a colonizer. Right. You guys are with me. And so what we see happening here in the Ottoman Empire, they were not able to modernize. And because they couldn't modernize, they ended up being torn apart by the European powers. Okay. By the imperial power. Okay. Questions? Comments about that? So at any rate, during that time period where they couldn't modernize, the Turkish EMP or the Ottoman Empire becomes known as Sick man of Europe. Okay? Sick man of Europe. Because it's not. Well, it's not strong enough to actually to withstand colonization, really, or conquest. But it is. But the reason why it's not taken over is because of the rivalry of the European powers, particularly the French, the British and the Russians. Right. So the rivalry of the European powers is they're going to be like vultures circulating, circling a dying person. Right. The only reason why any one of them didn't actually move in on the area, on the Empire was because they were afraid of conflict with the other powers. You get what I'm saying? So. So that's why they call it the Sick man of Europe. Questions? Comments about any of this? Time is a new way. Oh, man, I should have showed a longer movie. I'm done. Any questions at all? Keep in mind you got a lot of work to do. I hope that you don't think I'm just trying to pile too much on you, but I think it's all relevant to learning what we're doing here. And I think that you'll be pleased with the outcome, even if you don't. Even if you're cursing during the. During the work. Okay. Questions? Comments about any of this? No questions. All right, then. I'll see you on Tuesday. Live long and prosper. Thank you. Also, nice mug. Thank you, Professor. You're welcome. Have a good weekend. You, too. Thank you. Have a good one, guys. Thank you, Professor.

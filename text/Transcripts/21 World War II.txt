It Sam, with a purposeful grimace and a terrible sound equals the spitting hydra. Wires down. Helpless people outside up with trains scream my God. As he looks in on them. He picks up a bus and he throws it back down as he waves through the buildings toward the center of town. Oh, they say he's got to go. Oh, no. Godzilla. Godzilla. Godzilla. Godzilla. Godzilla. Ice cream. History shows again and again how bitch. Points up the poly up there. Godzilla. History shows. I'm getting up. Get out. Major. Points up the f. History shows again and again how nature boy. History shows again and again how nature one sucked the volume. Godzilla. You guys like my phone? Yes. Did you notice the lyric at the end? Nature points out again and again how nature points out the folly of man. That's pretty interesting, don't you think? Does anybody want to try and guess why I played Godzilla today? He a radioactive monster. Yeah, he actually. By the atomic bomb. Yeah, exactly. So anyway, so unfortunately, today we will actually learn something about the atomic bomb, among other things. So that's where we're at. Any questions or comments before I get started? Let me stop the share here, okay? No questions. Everybody's good. Let me just. I want to show you guys some stuff here. I have gotten a couple of comments from students who are concerned about non participation in the group project, and I want to help you guys to do that. So what I'm going to do, I want to meet with each one of your groups, but I don't think I'm going to have time to do it today. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make an assignment for you guys to conclude over the weekend. And then on. On Tuesday, we will meet in groups. And I actually had scheduled a reading for Tuesday, but I'm going to push that back until at least Thursday so that we can get going on this project. Because we have almost no time left on this. And I probably should have introduced it earlier to you guys, but I didn't want to introduce it before the withdrawal deadline. All right, so any questions or comments about that? Let me just show you what I want you to do. If you look at the panel discussion project, one of the things you'll see is on the very first page, there is a list of things that need to be done right. And this last one here, complete an individual peer evaluation. Has to be done by everybody. The rest of it is going to be divided. The rest of the tasks will be divided up among the members of the group. So what I would like for you guys to do before Tuesday's meeting is to decide who's going to do which tasks and when they are going to be due. And then I will meet with each group on Tuesday and we will go. We'll go over that. And keep in mind that the reason why I'm doing this is because I want to help you. I want to. I want this to be a useful activity for you guys. You guys got me questions, comments about this. So. So does that seem doable? I seem like something you can do by Tuesday? Yes, I think so. Yes. Okay. So, yeah. And then if you're not going to participate, it would be good for you to let your group know so that they can go ahead and make assignments without you. Right. And it's not. It's like, I should say it this way, it's not mandatory that you participate, but if you don't, you're not going to get a grade. Right. So basically then this. This assignment has a number of points attached to it. 300 points. Right. Out of a thousand. So. So it's not going to be a good idea for you to skip doing this. All right, so I'll just leave it at that. And again, you know, you can send me email if you have questions or comments or concerns and I'll try to address them. And we'll just leave it at that. All right? Questions, Comments about any of this. All right, so by. I'll write this up and I'll make a. Make an assignment on. On the canvas page, but by Tuesday, I'm going to want to see a schedule of who's doing what and by when. All right? Questions, Comments. Okay, so let me go back then. And do you guys see the. The. The slide set? World War II. World War again. You took us off this chair. Oh, yeah. So all that stuff I showed you, you couldn't see because I was up there, but now you see it. Right? Let me just go back because I want to make sure that you guys know what I'm talking about. This is. This is the. The Purified, the panel discussion project. And these five tasks are what you have to decide who's going to do it and when it's going to be done. Okay. By Tuesday. All right, questions, Comments on. Professor? Yes? Could we link with our group again? My phone broke and everything, and I don't have my connection with my group anymore. Well, I mean, we have. The groups are all listed on canvas and you can communicate to the members of your group through canvas. Does that help? Okay, yeah, I'll just message them on canvas to see yeah. And then also, like I said, I'm gonna. I don't think I will have time today, but on, on Tuesday, I'll put you guys all in groups, right. Together so that we can work this out. Okay. Questions, Comments? All right. Need a presentation, like a slideshow to show you while we present it. Well, I mean, it's always better with a presentation. I'm not requiring it. You have to do a presentation. Whether or not you have to do a graphic presentation, it's probably recommended, but not necessarily required. Does that answer your question? Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. What will happen is that the day that we do the presentations, I will turn the class over to the group that's. I'll turn the zoom over to the group that's presenting so that you can, you can present on your screens rather than me presenting. Okay. That answer your questions. All right, let's go ahead and, and dive in. And we got a lot to cover today. We're going to talk about World War. Let me just start off by we. The less. The lecture that I did on Tuesday basically had a preview of what was happening during the Great Depression that would lead to World War II. And I'm going to go into it in a little bit more detail now. We're going to start in Asia. We're going to start with Japanese expansion in the Pacific. And we will recall that Japan was an industrial economy that suffered the Great Depression like the other industrial economies. And that the solution that the Japanese came up with, particularly the Japanese military, basically the Japanese military took control of the government and they staged an invasion of Manchuria. With the idea being that they were going. Well, a, number one being that war in theory is supposed to be good for the economy, which it isn't, as I've explained to you. Right. But in B, the idea that they would be able to gain access to the resources that they needed for their industrial plant. So in that, in that way, they weren't really that much different from the European imperialists. All right. Anyway, they attacked Manchuria and then they withdraw from the League of Nations. All right. And there is no consequence for their withdrawal from the League of Nations, which demonstrates that the League of Nations essentially is useless. And then in 1937, they invade China. The full scale invasion of China, characterized by the rape of Nanjing or Nanking, which is here, which really demonstrates the brutality of the Japanese offensive. Because somewhere in the neighborhood of 200,000 or over 100,000, nobody knows the exact number, somewhere in the neighborhood of over 100,000 innocent people and surrendered soldiers were massacred by the Japanese. And there were reports of somewhere along the lines of 2,000 rapes a night in Nanking, which is obviously going to raise some concern, I guess you could say, you could under, say really among the Chinese against the Japanese. So at any rate, that really kind of demonstrates the, the word I'm looking for that really kind of demonstrates the brutality of the Japanese in World War II. We're going to talk a little bit more about the Japanese military in their, in their ideology in a minute. Right, but. And I am pointing out that the Japanese become brutal, that their military conduct is brutal, but we'll also find that they're not alone in this. So we'll just leave it at that for now. Any questions? Comments about that? A couple of things that Japan did. Japan joined what's known as the anti Comintern pact. There was a concern about communism kind of going along with the idea of the, the Red scare that happened in the United States because of the revolution in Russia and the, remember that we talked about the Comintern, which was the communist International Committee in the Soviet Union, whose job was. What was their job? The purpose of the Comintern? To spread communism. Right. To export communism. Right. Because the idea, the theory is that you can't have communism anywhere unless you have it everywhere. So the stated foreign policy of the Soviet Union at that time was to basically export communism to every part of the world. All right? And there were a number of people that were concerned about that in the United States everywhere really. But what happens is that two countries, Germany and Italy, will join in a pact that, that opposes the spread of communism. And Japan will essentially will join that plan, eventually join that pact. The reason why Japan joins is mostly, I mean, yeah, they were anti communist, but mostly because the Soviet or the Russians essentially are their historical enemies in Asia. So they join with basically what we will call the Axis powers in Europe or the fascist powers in Europe against the Soviet Union. And then later what will happen is that Hitler will make a deal with the Russians, a non aggression pact, and the Japanese will withdraw from the anti Comintern pact. But they later rejoin Germany and Italy in what's called the Tripartite Pact. Okay. The reason why that's important is because that means that if any country attacks, or I should say it this way, if, if Japan goes to war with any country, then the, the Germans and the Italians will be on the hook to join them in that war. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, we'll leave it at that then. It's really the, the interesting part about that is that goes, if Japan, if another country declares war on Japan, then the Italians and the Germans will be on the hook to come to their aid. All right, questions? Comments? I knew this. All right, so now in Europe, remember, we talked about some of the responses to the stresses of the Great Depression and we talked about desperate solutions. And one of those solutions we talked about was corporatism and courtism. Basically, as we discussed earlier, was a one is a one party state where all of the decisions, the national, the I guess you could say conflicts between different segments of, excuse me, of society are resolved within the party. Right. The model for this is the Italian Fascist Party. Right. It's a far right ultra national political movement. Their idea was that they were going to essentially organize society in such a way that they could overcome the effects of the Great Depression. And what I'm showing you here is an illustration of a facie. And this illustration is the, is of the symbol of the Roman Empire. The symbol of the Roman Empire was this, this bundle of sticks that was, because it was bundled together like that was incredibly powerful. All right, so that's a symbol of the Roman Empire and it shows the nationalist appeal of the fascists to restore the, the glory of, of the Roman Empire, essentially. All right, which is going to end up being kind of a fiasco for the, for the Italians. But we'll talk a little bit more about that later. All right, so the, again, the idea here of, of fascism is the idea that the country needs to be saved from liberals and communists and socialists and that there's a party that can do that. But beyond that, there's also a personality that can do that. This guy Benito Mussolini becomes a symbol of fascism in Italy. Then we can see, as we already know, comparable movements subsequently developed in Germany and other places like Latin America, which I talked about. Okay, so wait a minute. This is not how it's supposed to work. Okay, so now what happens in Germany kind of going along at the same period of time and with the same kind of ideology? After World War II, many people were. Well, first off, they were challenged by the Great Depression and the inflation and the, what's the word I'm looking for? The Great Depression and the inflation and the humiliation of having lost the war. And that frustration was turned into anger against, essentially against the Jews by a single individual, really. Adolf Hitler becomes the leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party. The one thing I want you guys to take away from this today for sure is that it's called National Socialism, but it is absolutely nothing to do with socialism. People who are ignorant of history and basically idiots will tell you that the Nazis were socialists, but they were not socialists. They hated the socialists. Right? So we want to, we want to put that kind of notion to rest right up front that the German, the Nazis were not socialists. Right. What they were is they were again this one party state ruled by a strong man, the Fuhrer. Who is this guy here? I have to tell you, I'm going to make a confession that I did everything I could to demystify and de glorify the Nazis and their regime because they were absolute incredible, horribly blot on world history. And anybody who glorifies the Nazis is really has to be, I believe, anti human. Not just anti democratic, but anti human. Right. At any rate, the point here is that it did attract a lot of people. They were frightened by the growing strength of the Communist Party and they were also inspired, I guess you could say by the idea that Hitler's idea that, that he could rebuild, he could restore Germany to its glorious past. Right. Unlike the, the Italians, the, the Germans didn't have a historical glorious past. So, so basically Hitler made one up, right? And, and he had this idea that there was a. He basically took the kind of mythology of the Norse, of the Nordic peoples and the Germanic peoples, I guess you could say, and the kind of imagination of the Wagner operas that contain that ideology or that mythology and turned it into history. So that he said basically that at one point the German, all the German people were united in this great Reich which is like a nation, and that they were the superior people, that they were the Orion people and they were superior to every other people on earth. Right. And this is going to be a very compelling image for people in Germany now, particularly who are concerned with the loss of national pride after, after World War I. All right, so questions, comments about this? Okay, so the Nazi. Here's an interesting thing. This is true. Both in, both in Italy and in Germany, both Hitler and Mussolini were elected, right? So you know, there has been for a long time an idea that something like this could not happen in the United States because we have a democracy. But both Italy and Germany had the resemblance semblance of a democracy. And both Mussolini and Hitler were elected to office. And it was after they were elected to office that they destroyed civil rights and destroyed the democracy. So probably don't remember back to the very beginning, the first day of class, when I talked about the Popper paradox where, where if you are tolerant of intolerance, the tolerant society will disappear. This is exactly what happened in Germany. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, so now one of the things that happens, one of the things that, one of the ways that the Nazi party made themselves seem essential to the defense of Germany was that they deliberately set fire to the national legislature called the Reichstag. And then they said basically, we have to declare a state of emergency to oppose the Jews and the communists and the socialists. And the result of it is going to be that they impose a very strict dictatorial rule. Okay, now here's what's about this, what's interesting. I mean, there's lots of things that are interesting, but one thing that's very interesting about this is that you have to ask, well, why would people go along with that? Why would people go along with giving up their civil rights and being, being, you know, formed into kind of a militant society? Why would people give up their, their, their, you know, rule of law and, and those sorts of things. And the answer is because they felt that this guy Hitler and the Nazi Party were actually doing what they said they were going to do, which was to make Germany great again. Right? And the way that they were doing was they were rebuilding the military. They were, they were providing jobs by, by doing, rebuilding the, the military. They were standing up to foreign powers. And the Germans were, were happy with that. There was almost, I should say, it's, it's. I, I'm not really, I'm not what we're looking for. I'm not promoting the Nazi regime. But the reality is that before World War II, there was almost no unemployment in Germany. It was almost full employment in Germany because of the policies of the Nazi Party. All right, questions? Comments? And so really what that shows is that people are willing to give up their freedom for creature comforts in many cases. All right, questions? Comments? All right, now, oops, there's one more. I don't know why it keeps doing that. Okay, so, so now we walk through what happens in the, the, the rise of Nazism in Germany, right? We start with again, Mein Kampf, which I talked a little bit about Tuesday. And that was Hitler's manifesto of his vision of the future for the, the German nation. And the first thing that they were going to do was repudiate the Treaty of Versailles. Second thing that they were going to do, this is all according to Mein Kampf, is unification of the German speaking people and then finally the expansion to the east for Lebensraum, which is living space. All right? And so what we See, happening then in the 1930s is exactly what Hitler proposed in 1925. So when Hitler takes control of the government, he starts German rearmament. The Germans had been forced to disarm after World War I, and now they're actually rebuilding their military so that they can compete with the French and the British and whoever else. Right? They occupy the Rhineland. The Rhineland was an industrial area here that had been occupied by the Western Allies, the French and the British, in order to extract reparations from Germany. But he sends troops into the Rhineland. And the Rhineland is. Then basically the German and French are removed, are forced to remove themselves. And the result was nothing because by this time, the Western Allies were really thoroughly demoralized by the Depression and by the kind of failures of the things that they had fought for in World War I. And then in 1938, he uses his army to annex Austria on the pretense that they are German people and that they want to be part of this Greater Germany. And then in 1938, he threatens to. To annex or to invade the Sudetenland. That's this little kind of these little pink blobs here which are part of Czechoslovakia, right? And he. Basically, what's happening is that there's agitation within the Sudetenland of people who are. Who admire the Nazi regime and want to join with their German fellows. And what happens is that Hitler threatens to invade. And the Western Allies are concerned to a certain extent with the idea that Hitler is not going to stop. So they propose a conference in Munich in 1938, which was attended by the British, the French, the Germans and the Italians, not to Czechoslovakians. And the idea there was that they made a deal with Hitler. Hitler said that he was not. He had no further territorial ambitions and that. That. That once he had been able to occupy the Rhineland or, excuse me, the Sudetenland, that he would. There would be no more military conflict. And the. The Allies adopted what was known as a policy of appeasement. Appeasement means, okay, we'll give them what they want. Hopefully they'll stop. But as we know, that didn't happen. So Hitler was allowed basically to walk into and take the Sudetenland away from Czechoslovakia. And then in 1939, his army invades Czechoslovakia and takes over the rest of the country. And then he decides. And again, this is part of his plan, his master plan, to reunite all the German people by overrunning Poland. And the British and the French both warn Hitler that if Poland is invaded, they will declare war. And Hitler ignores that warning. Although he kind of, it's really kind of a. It's too sad to think of as comedy, but the fact that he staged this theoretical. What happened was that German, German soldiers went into Poland, grabbed Polish soldiers, killed them, brought them back into Germany and took pictures of them and said, see, the Polish have invaded us, so we have to respond. And so then on September 1, 1939, Hitler's armies invade Poland. It's interesting that at the same time the Soviet Union invades the rest of Poland because the Soviet Union and Greater Germany had, had made a deal about, secret deal about who was going to get what in Poland. At any rate, the point here is that after that the British and the French declare war. So now war in theory is going to exist from September 1, 1939. And I forgot to make a link to this, but I will make a link to it before the day's over. I hope that there was a point that was written by British poet named W.H. auden and the name of the poem was 9-1-1939. And I think it's a very good take on the beginning of World War II. So I'm going to make that available to you guys. It's pretty short. It's not like one of those 50 page poems or something like that. Right. Anyway, so, so really what we're going to see is not then exactly, but in the spring we'll see the German armies essentially take over the rest of Europe. Okay. And so, so by the time we get to 1941, 1942, Europe is essentially under the domination of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. All right, Questions? Comments about this? And I got this painting here just to show kind of the ideology and the ambition of the German people and their thousand year Reich. Okay. And you can see this massive military might, but what's behind it? The ruins of civilization. Right. Okay. Questions? Comments about any of this? Okay, now, so let's talk about. Let's continue our discussion of the war. I started off by telling you festival Europa means Fortress Europe. Okay. And what that means is that by, by 1942 Europe was essentially fortified against what we call the Allies, the British, the French and later the Americans. Right. What we see here is that we started with the invasion of Poland. And then in the spring there's invasion of Denmark and Norway which fell very quickly. Then there's the invasion of Belgium and France which was a reenactment of the Schlieffen plan that the, the Germans had attempted in World War I but had failed. And then after that begins the Battle of Britain, where the Luftwaffe or the German air force tries to force Britain to capitulate to surrender. The biggest problem that Hitler had was he couldn't imagine how to invade Germany. They did have some plans that they were, excuse me, not Germany in England. And he did have plans for that, but it was, it was kind of a, kind of a mental obstacle for him. Okay. And, and the, I, I don't know if you guys know this, I just want to mention it that the, the German air force was almost successful in wiping out the British Air force during the Battle of Britain. But what happened was that one mission of the German air force flew off course and dropped bombs on civilians in England. And this causes outrage in England, but not only does it cause outrage in England, the outrage causes the Germans to change their focus from bombing air force bases to bombing cities. And because of that, the air force, the Royal Air Force, was able to regroup and eventually defeat the German air force. All right, so anyway, that's just, you know, there's so many stories that you could tell about World War II. That's just one of them. All right, Questions, Comments about anything. All right, so now we're ready to implement the last part of the plan was. The last part of the plan. The last part of the plan was, well, we're going to take over this area here, we're going to take over the oil fields and we're going to take over the, the agricultural areas. And that's going to give us Lebensraum place to, to live. And what about the people that are there already? Well, they're not really human. They're, they're intermention. And because of that, we can either enslave them or just wipe them out. It's okay either way. Right, so. So Hitler and his, his armies then invade Russia. Now there's some controversy about the, the timing of the invasion because it was originally time to go in, I think may, but it didn't actually go until June. And one of the reasons that's been put forward, one of the explanations for that that's been put forward was that Italy was having a heck of a time trying to conquer Yugoslavia. Remember, they were trying to rebuild the Roman Empire. And so Hitler diverted German troops to assist in that. Right. But that diversion caused a 38 delay in the beginning of the, of the invasion of Russia. And one of the problem with the problem that that is going to cause is that the invasion of Russia imagined the fall of the Soviet Union before the onset of winter. And so that meant that the German army in the Soviet Union was not equipped when they were bogged down before Moscow in the winter of 1940. Of 1940. Right. And so that's going to cause eventually the Germans to. To be forced to retreat. It doesn't happen right away, but. But it's going to. It's going to serious. Put a serious wrench in Hitler's plan for world conquest. All right. Questions? Comments about this? All right, now what happens in the Pacific? All right. Well, kind of go backward in time a little bit. Right. Japan has already occupied China and Manchuria, and now in 1940, they move to occupy French Indochina. Well, why 1940? Well, the reason why is because the French government has capitulated. Right. So the Japanese basically take what's left of their empire in Asia, and that's going to cause the Americans to respond rather forcefully, really, because the American, the president of the United States, Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, is concerned about the encirclement of the Philippine islands, which are controlled by the United States at that time. Right. So what that does is it creates a kind of an economic crisis between the United States and Japan, which really exacerbates the situation because now Japan needs to find a way to replace those resources that they're no longer getting from the United States. And so what they do is they, as I've mentioned to you before, they devise a plan where they're going to expand into the Pacific and take everything that they think that they need to support their industry and then stop and say, okay, we're done now. And their idea is that the rest of the world, particularly the United States, will be so distracted and weary that they'll just accept this as a fait accompli. The problem was that as part of this plan, they really discounted the American will to fight. And you can imagine why, because of the neutrality treaties and all that. But they were concerned that, well, what if they do? And so what they did was they decided that they were going to bomb the American fleet at Pearl harbor as part of this offensive. Not that they were going to take Hawaii or any of that, but that. That they wanted to disable the American fleet. And that actually has a reverse effect on the Americans. Rather than causing them to be despair and disillusion, it causes them to basically unify and what's the word I'm looking for? To rally against the Japanese. So this is going to be then that on December 8, 1941, the United States declares war on Japan. And then once United States has declared war on Japan, Germany And Italy declare war against the United States because of the Tripartite Pact. All right, you guys with me. Questions? Comments? So now we have basically all of the. The actors in place, okay? And one of the ways that you can think about World War II rather than thinking about it as this big war, which it kind of was, but it was really three different wars happening at once. And one of the wars was happening in Europe between the Western Allies and the Germans. One of the wars was happening in Eastern Europe between the Germans and the Russians, and the other war was happening in Asia or in the Pacific between the Western Allies and Japan. Now we have all three wars going on at the same time. Questions? Comments about this? Okay, so now, before this, and you guys will remember that the United States was neutral, had declared neutrality, but really didn't act very neutral. The United States was really supporting the British by escorting merchant fleets and by eventually by selling military equipment or lending. Lending military equipment to the British in return for leases on British bases. And there had been consultation between the leaders of the United States and Britain. That's between Roosevelt and Churchill in what were known as the ABC Talks. ABC means America, Britain and Canada. But the idea here is that Roosevelt had already started preparing the United States for war, even though they had declared neutrality. And not only that, but they had made strategic plans for what would happen when America did enter the war. All right? And so one of the things that they agreed on was that if the United States was drawn into the war against Germany and Italy and Japan, that the British would be in that war with them, but that they would fight the war in Europe first and then the one in Asia. Okay? The reason for that, from the English point of view, was because the English were having a hard time surviving, particularly when the Nazis took North Africa and almost took the Suez Canal, which connected Germany, excuse me, Britain with their empire and with their resources. And so Churchill was concerned that they would not be able to survive if the Americans began their intervention, began their. Their campaign in the Pacific rather than in Europe. Okay, you guys are following me here. Questions? Okay, now let me just mention to you that this is the plan, but this is. Isn't really what happens, because what happens is the United States sends troops to Africa first. We'll talk a little bit about that in a minute. Right? But it also begins its offensive operations in the Pacific. So. So even though the United States had said that it was going to fight the war in Europe first and then in the Pacific, it actually fights both wars at the same time. Right? From the Very beginning. Right. And really only the United States was to do that. Because the United States, although it had been in depression for almost a decade, still had the most powerful industrial plant in the world. All right, questions? Comments? Okay. Oh, let me just mention to you, why did I call this the Greater East Asia Prosperity Sphere? And the reason why is because that's what the Japanese tried to tell the people of Asia that they were doing, that they were all going to come together as one country and that they would all prosper together. But as I've already mentioned to you, the brutality of the, of the Japanese soldiers made the people of Asia realize that they were not equals. They were not considered to be equals by the Japanese. All right, questions? Comments? Okay. What was that? I must have missed something here. Okay, right, so here, this one. Now we're going to talk about the end of the war in Europe. Because it ended first, right? The first thing that happens. I don't really have a good map. I wish I did. I could have done a better map than this. But let's just say it this way, that the United States troops, the very first place that they land. In fact, let me try and find a different map here. Maybe this one. Maybe this one. Yeah. Okay, you can see here a little bit better, right, that the United States invades North Africa. Why North Africa? And the reason why is because the Germans are putting pressure on Egypt. And Egypt is important to Britain not just because it's part of the British Empire, but because that's where the Suez Canal is, right? So The Americans, the first American forces in World War II, land in North Africa. And the reality is that the American forces are way underprepared against the Germans. But the campaign in North Africa, eventually the campaign turns around and the American forces become an effective fighting force. So at any rate, it's kind of like a proving ground or a crucible for the American forces, right? They, they land in North Africa and they're eventually able to remove the, the Germans and their threat from, from the, of the Suez Canal. All right, what happens then is that there's this very unlikely alliance between the British, the Americans and the Soviet Union. You will remember that the United States and Britain were both anti communist and that the Soviet Union had made it a stated foreign policy goal to do away with the American and the British governments. So you have to wonder, well, why were they all allied? And of course, the obvious answer is actually it was stated well by Winston Churchill when he said that if Hitler invaded hell, then he would be allied with Satan and That's exactly what we see happening here. Right. So it's an unlikely alliance, but the three, the big three meet together a couple of different times. And the plan that they. Well, I'm just saying first off that the, the British are concerned about North Africa, the Russians are concerned about opening a new front in Western Europe to take some of the pressure off of Eastern Europe and the Eastern Front. Okay. So that's kind of the back and forth that happens. Eventually. What ends up happening essentially is both things. Right. So Churchill's plan was to take North Africa and then take Italy and march into Germany from the south, what he called the soft underbelly of Europe. The eventual plan and the plan that Stalin really wanted was for allies to invade France and march into Germany that way. Right. So both of those things actually happen, but the one that has the most effect, essentially these armies that are fighting here in Italy get bogged down. Right. But once the D Day invasion happens, the, the capitulation of the, of the German forces is pretty rapid. They're basically pushed back. The only place that they, they give a little bit of a sign of, of recovery is in what's called the Battle of the Bulge right here. Right. And what that, basically the reason why they call it a bulge is because the, the Germans are able to push back the Allied front in what looked like a bulge, but it only lasted for days. And then the, the assault on Germany continued after that. Right. And unlike what happened in World War I. Sorry, I pushed the wrong button again. Unlike what happened In World War I, in World War II, the Allies actually entered Germany and started to march on Berlin. All right, so this is by 1944, 1945. All right, questions? Comments about this? Are you guys following this narrative? Is this. Okay? All right, all right, so. All right, so you'll also notice that after D Day, the Russians are able to make gains in the East. So now we have the Russians descending on Germany from the east and the Allies from the west. And Germany is basically unable to withstand it. All right, and eventually what will happen In May of 1945, the German. What's left of the German government is forced to surrender. And that's what we call VE Day Victory in Europe. Okay, I did want to. I can't go past this before calling to your attention. And I know you guys know about this, and it's actually kind of astonishing to me, really, if you think about it, that something like this could happen within the memory of people who are still alive today, and that people will either deny it or Downplay it. Or that people will essentially agree with the sentiment that sent 6 million Jews to places like Auschwitz to be murdered. Right? But this is what the Nazis did. And people then, like I say, the people who are. Who are complementary or who glorify Nazism, either they are completely ignorant of history or they're monsters. That's the only two explanations. Right? And if they are ignorant of history, then that's our problem. Because as Blue Oyster Cult tells us, history shows again and again the folly of man. How nature points out the folly of man. All right, okay, so this is. This is something that should not be forgotten. Just so you know. I don't know if you guys know this, but actually, holocaust is the Hebrew word for. For sacrifice. And what that means is that in the time of Israel as a nation, during, for example, the time of the Roman Empire, they would do sacrifices in the temple. And what they would do is they would sacrifice goats or sheep or whatever by burning them. And. And that would be an offering to God to atone for the sins of the people. Right? So when we call this the Holocaust, the idea behind that is that. And many people subscribe to this, is that the Jewish people have, from their. From. From, you know, 3,000 years ago, have. Have thought of themselves as being a nation that must sacrifice in order to atone for the sins of man. Anyway, that's why. That's why it's called the Holocaust. All right, questions? Comments about this? Okay, then this, I just wanted to show you this. This is the. The end of the thousand year ride that lasted 12 years. All right, questions? Comments about any of this. Let me just. Also, the last thing I want to mention here before I'm done is this word Gottardamarung. This is actually part of the. Of a Wagner opera. And Gothard Gammerang is the twilight of the gods. The idea of the twilight of the gods is that everything is destroyed at the end. Right? And some people claim. Well, actually it's probably true that Hitler in the last days of the Reich, in his bunker, ordered his military to destroy everything and everybody in Germany, right? So he was trying to bring about this twilight of the gods. Fortunately, they weren't able to do that. All right, questions? Comments about this. All right, last thing did they attempt to do that? I think for the most part, they didn't have the ability to do that. Most of the military officers who were not in the bunker had already decided that Hitler was a losing proposition. And they were trying to figure out different ways to get out of the end of the war. Does that answer your question? Yes. Okay, so now I already talked about the brutality when I talked about the invasion of China. But what happens, the strategy that the Americans adopt is what's called island hopping. And the idea behind island hopping, that they will take one of these islands that's occupied by Japanese and then hop over other islands and then they'll take another island, taking strategic islands until they can work their way up into bombing range of Japan, which they end up being able to do. But it's a very, the. It's a very costly campaign. And the reason why it's so costly is because the Japanese will not surrender. And there's different explanations for why they won't surrender. Right? But the reality is that in order to take anything from the Japanese, you had to kill all of them. You couldn't. They would not surrender. Right. And in fact, when Americans did surrender, as they did when the Japanese took the Philippine Islands, they treated him with total disrespect because they thought they were cowards. Right? So at any rate, kind of a difference in culture there. The point is that eventually, oh, by the way, this also happens that because the Americans didn't take every island that the Japanese had occupied, some of these islands were left with Japanese military still on them. And some of these people that were still on these islands didn't know the war was over for at least for as much as 40 years afterwards. Right? Some, some people didn't surrender until 40 years after the war was already over. Right? And so that, that idea that, you know, the Japanese soldiers on the islands in the Pacific, that's all true. And the main reason why is because the Japanese government abandoned them after, after they lost the war. Right? Questions? Comments? All right, so, so basically then what happens is they get within bombing range of Japan and they set out on a, a campaign of bombing with fire bombs, incendiary bombs, 67 Japanese cities, killing hundreds of thousands of people. And then In August of 1945, decision is made to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Right? The Americans had two bombs and they decided to drop both of them with the idea that they were going to try to force the surrender of Japan because the alternative was an invasion of Japan. And the Allies were concerned, and probably with good reason, that if they invaded the island of Japan, probably there would be a million casualties, a million people would die in the invasion of Japan. So they wanted to try to avert that. At least that's some of the explanation for why the bomb was dropped. Another explanation is also, by this time The Soviets had withdrawn from the alliance and some people thought it was a demonstration for Stalin to take note of. But at any rate, the point here is that they did drop the bomb and then after that the Japanese did surrender. Right. So this was actually a quote by the Emperor after they dropped the second bomb. See, we have to endure the unendurable and bear the unbearable. All right, questions, comments about this? Okay, now I have a little bit of a video clip here and I'm going to show it to you. And the guy who's talking in this video clip, his name is Robert McNamara and he was, was the Secretary of War for Kennedy and Johnson. So he was the American Secretary of War during, or the Secretary of Defense during the, during the Vietnam War. Right. But he's talking here about his time when he was in the American military in the Pacific during World War II. So I want you to watch this and then I want, let's. We'll think about what it's telling us afterwards. The USA Force had a new airplane named the B29. The B17s and B24s in Europe bombed from 15, 16,000ft. The problem was that they were subject to anti aircraft fire and to fighter aircraft. To relieve that, this B29 was being developed. It bombed from high altitude and it was thought we could destroy targets much more efficiently and effectively. I was brought back from the 8th Air Force and assigned to the first B29s, the 58 Bomb Wing. We had to fly those planes from the bases in Kansas to India. Then we had to fly fuel over the hump into China. The airfields were built with Chinese labor. It was an insane operation. I can still remember hauling these huge rollers to crush the stone, make them flat, long rope. Somebody had slipped, the roller would roll over and everybody laugh and go on. We were supposed to take these B29s. There were no tanker aircraft. We were to fill them with fuel, fly from India to Shang Tu, offload the fuel, fly back to India, make enough missions to build up fuel in Shang Tu, fly to Yawata, Japan, bomb the steel mills and go back to India. We had so little training on this problem of maximizing efficiency, we actually found to get some of the B29s back, instead of offloading fuel, they had to take it on. To make a long story short, it wasn't worth a damn. And it was LeMay who really came to that conclusion and led the chiefs to move the whole thing to the Marianas, which devastated Japan. LeMay was focused on only one thing, target destruction. Most Air Force generals could tell you how many planes they had, how many tons of bombs they dropped, or whatever the hell it was. But he was the only person that I knew in the senior command, Air Force, who focused solely on the loss of his crews per unit of target destruction. I was on the island of Guam in his command in March of 1945. In that single night, we burned to death 100,000 Japanese civilians in Tokyo. Men, women and children. Were you aware this was going to happen? Well, I was. I was part of a mechanism that, in a sense, recommended it. I analyzed bombing operations and how to make them more efficient, that is, not more efficient in the sense of killing more, but more efficient in weakening the adversary. I wrote one report analyzing the efficiency of the B29 operations. The B29 could get above the fighter aircraft and above the air defense, so the whole loss rate would be much less. The problem was the accuracy was also much less. Now, I don't want to suggest that it was my report that led to. I'll call it the fire bombing. It isn't that I'm trying to absolve myself of blame for the firebombing. I don't want to suggest it was I that put in LeMay's mind that his operations were totally inefficient and had to be drastically changed. But anyhow, that's what he did. He took the B29s down to 5,000ft and he decided to bomb with fire bombs. I participated in the interrogation of the B29 bomber crews that came back that night. A room full of crewmen and intelligence interrogators. Captain got up, young Captain, and said, God damn it, I'd like to know who this son of a bitch was that took this magnificent airplane designed to bomb from 23,000ft. And he took it down to 5,000ft and I lost my wingman. He was shot and killed. LeMay spoke in monosyllables. I never heard him say more than two words in sequence. Was basically, yes, no. Yep, that's hell. That was all he said. And Lame was totally intolerant of criticism. He never engaged in discussion with anybody. He stood up. Why are we here? Why are we here? You lost your wingman. It hurts me as much as it does you. I sent him there and I've been there. I know what it is. But you lost one wingman and we destroyed Tokyo. 50 square miles of Tokyo were burned. Tokyo was a wooden city. And when we dropped these firebombs and it just burned it. Sam. The choice of incendiary bombs. Where did that come from? I think the issue is not so much incendiary bombs. I think the issue is, in order to win a war, should you kill 100,000 people in one night by firebombing or any other way? LeMay's answer would be clearly, yes. McNamara, do you mean to say that. That Instead of killing 100,000, burning to death 100,000 Japanese civilians in that one night, we should have burned to death a lesser number or none, and then had our soldiers crossed the beaches in Tokyo and been slaughtered in the tens of thousands? Is that what you're proposing? Is that moral? Is that wise? Why was it necessary to drop the nuclear bomb if LeMay was burning up Japan and he went on from Tokyo to firebomb other cities? 58% of Yokohama. Yokohama is roughly the size of Cleveland. 58% of Cleveland destroyed. Tokyo is roughly the size of New York. 51% of New York destroyed. 99% of the equivalent of Chattanooga, which was Toyona. 40% of the equivalent of Los Angeles, which was Nagoya. This was all done before the dropping of the nuclear bomb, which, by the way, was dropped by LeMay's command. Proportionality should be a guideline of war. Killing 50 to 90% of the people of 67 Japanese cities and then bombing them with two nuclear bombs is not proportional in the minds of some people to the objectives we were trying to achieve. I don't fault Truman for dropping the nuclear bomb. The US Japanese war was one of the most brilliant, brutal wars in all of human history. Kamikaze pilots, suicide, unbelievable. What one can criticize is that the human race prior to that time and today has not really grappled with what are. I'll call it the rules of war. Was there a rule of land that said you shouldn't bomb, shouldn't kill, shouldn't burn to death 100,000 civilians in a night? LeMay said if we'd lost the war, we'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals. And I think he's right. He, and I'd say I were behaving as war criminals. Lame recognized that what he was doing would be thought immoral if his side had lost. But what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win? What makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win? Because it's the victor that writes like the history. So if we say we're not, you know, we're criminals because we were thinking about our soldiers storming the beaches, you know, in the grand scheme of Things decided we'll save American lives, just drop two atomic bombs, you know. But to the Japanese, you know, obviously that with fire bombings and all that stuff, you know, from their perspective where the criminals. So it's this perspective thing. I guess so. So thanks for sharing that, James. Why do you think, what do you guys think about the idea of rules of war? Should there be rules of. I say, yeah, there should be rules. And you can try. Yeah. I mean, you could tell someone not to do whatever you want, but it doesn't mean they're not going to do it. Yeah. Once you've decided to go to war and kill people for whatever you want, that's, that's very hard to, you know, the rules get thrown out. There are rules against. Right. What the Germans were supposed to do post World War I. They obviously didn't follow those rules that, you know, were also like unjust rules imposed upon them post. And. Yeah, I don't know. There's. It is what it is. And then, yeah, if you make the decision to kill people, everything else goes out the window. Okay. Okay, so let's, let's, let's stay focused on World War II here for now and say American kids, young people like 18, 19, 20 years old, were sent to places, islands in the Pacific to fight against the Japanese. And these American kids have been raised in our society where we theoretically value life and we value morality. Right. And yet, you know, what they report is that after not very much time in this, in this atmosphere of brutality, they become animals themselves. All right, so what does that tell us then about the idea of a moral war that doesn't exist? It doesn't exactly. At all. So if it's, if it's immoral. If it's immoral, how can it have rules? Right, guys are with me. Okay. Well, I, I didn't actually. I don't know if you noticed, but I actually put the questions up for the final here so you can take a look at them. And one of them is actually on this little video clip that we just saw. Right. Right here is where it is. Okay, so give you guys something to think about. Now, we haven't got very much time left, but if you want me to, I can open up breakout rooms. What do you guys want? Or you just want to leave? It's up to you. I think only me and one other person from our group is here, so I don't know if that'll be very helpful for us. Well, I'll tell you what, I'm just going to say have a Happy weekend. And hopefully get your work done by Tuesday. And we'll hopefully get it all straightened out by Tuesday. And. Because I want you guys to do well on these things, and I, I know that if you do it right, you'll learn a lot and I think you'll enjoy it. So. So I'm just going to help you try to stay focused on that and I'll let you go. And if anybody wants to talk together, whatever I can, I can help you guys after class. So live long and prosper. Thank you. Thank you, Professor Harrison. Wait, so with the final, I'm looking at the questions. Thank you, Professor. It's structured similar to the midterm. Right. Except it's not going to be in groups. You're going to be for sure answering. Oh, yeah, we're going to do groups again. We are doing groups. We're going to be in groups. Okay. Yeah, I, I really think that I, I don't think. I'm not sure how effective it was to, to put you guys in groups, but I, I do think that people who otherwise would not burn anything will at least learn something from being involved in this group final or group exam. Does that make sense? Okay. I can kind of see where you're coming from. I think at the same time, I don't know, this is my personal opinion, but, like, the. Those people that wouldn't normally learn anything still are not going to learn too much and instead just going to rely on their other group members to do like. Because how I'd think of it, let's say, okay, theoretically, let's say I was a kid who really didn't care and just coasting through and not really here to learn the material. Right. If I were to see a final in which I know that I'm expected to do it all on my own, I would take more of an incentive to actually, like, learn the material so I'd be able to answer all those questions. But if you see that it's like, okay, we're going to be in groups, you would just take the position of, all right, I'm not going to do anything, or I'm going to do the bare minimum and let everyone else carry the knowledge that I don't know, or basically the entire, you know, I don't know. I can kind of see you're coming from. Yeah, I get what you're saying. And that I, I get what you're saying. And, and the reason why. That's the reason why I put the pure peer evaluations. Yeah. Is that you guys are supposed to be able to grade each other. Right. People account. I don't know who does what. And so you guys need to be able to hold each other accountable. And what happens a lot of times is everybody just marks, you know, give everybody a five whether he did anything or not. So how am I supposed to know who did what? You know what I mean? So, anyway. But that's the reason for the fear of evaluation. I. I totally sympathize with you. When I was in college, you know, I never liked group work, but, you know, we have to do it sometimes, so. Yeah, I get it. So. All right. Thanks for. I was one. I always wanted to. I always wanted to rely on my own. My own rise or fall on my own merits. Yeah. So, Ryan. Ryan, the reason why I did the. The assignment that I just made and the idea that we're all going to meet on Tuesday was an answer to your concern from. From Tuesday, which I think is helpful. I think that. I don't know, it sounded like it was. Yeah. Yeah. Good for other groups as well. So thank you. Okay, guys, our guy. I'll see. I'll see you on Tuesday. See ya. Have a good one.

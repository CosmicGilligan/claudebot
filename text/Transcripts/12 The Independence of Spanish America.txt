Do you guys like my song? You did? You didn't. I didn't get any audio. You didn't get any audio? Oh, crap. Damn. No audio? Sorry. Somebody should have said something, and we had no audio. We didn't know. We were just staring. Yeah, well, anyway, I don't really have time to play this song because I started a little bit late because they're out there doing work on my street, and I have to leave when we're done here, and so I had to move my car so that I could get out of here. Anyway, you guys don't need to know my. My sad story. How's everybody doing today? We good? Any questions or comments about anything that I can help you with? I want to show you guys a couple of things, and I. I don't want you to feel like that you should be overwhelmed, but we got some things. We're going to have a busy couple of weeks here. Okay, so the. Let's start off with the midterm. Let me share the screen with you now. Okay, so these are the questions for the midterm. And what do. Is. I'm going to. Wait. That's not what I wanted to do there. This is what I want to do when I'm. This. This is all the questions that might be on the test. Right. There actually will be a smaller number of questions on a test, probably 15, and then you'll have to answer 10. The way I'm going to do it is I'm going to divide you guys into groups, and you're going to do group midterms. And that may sound really weird, but the reason why I'm doing it that way is because I want you guys to collaborate so that you guys come up with good answers rather than just guessing or not answering it at all. And I know that it's more difficult to keep track of what's going on in class when we're actually doing it online. And so I think that the best solution to that that I've come up with is that I'll have you guys do it together. You guys can support each other, and that way, everybody should get a good grade on the midterm. Now, the thing that I want to keep in mind here is that the grade for the midterm is going to be a group grade, not an individual grade. Right. So if the group. If somebody in the group doesn't participate or doesn't answer the question or answer the question wrong, that will. Let's say. Let's say it the other way around. If somebody in the group answers a question wrong and the group doesn't correct it, then everybody gets that question wrong. And that's so that. That's why you should all be on board with the answers that you turn in. But if somebody doesn't collaborate at all, there will be. At the end of the exam, there will be a peer review online, and you can. The groups can tell me who participated and who didn't. And if you didn't participate, then you don't get any credit at all. Right. There's only going to be one exam turned in per group. Okay. So. So if you. If you decide that you don't want to participate at the beginning and then later decide you do and the group has already turned into the work, then there's nothing I can do about that. So you have to all be together with this in the beginning. All right. I'm letting you know a week ahead of time. This doesn't start till next Thursday. Are there any questions about this? You have the questions now? None of. There are no questions. I do have a question. Is somebody talking? Okay. Yeah, go ahead. My question is, will we all be on in Zoom while doing this test? You guys will do whatever. You guys can collaborate any way you see fit. There is. You can use Zoom or you can use, you know, Google Groups, or you can use. There's something on Zoom on Canvas called Pronto, where you can talk to each other in groups. Anything that works for you guys. So I can. I did at one time try to organize it into group rooms, but it doesn't really work out. It's a lot more difficult for me to do that than it is for you guys just to figure out using email or chat or whatever it is you guys use. Does it answer your question? Yes. What I will do, though, is next Thursday when the midterm begins, I will make sure that everybody has the opportunity to get into a group by putting you in rooms or. Or whatever. Okay. So make sure that you're not just on your own. Okay. I'll help you in that way. Any other questions? So it'll be available starting Thursday and due that night? No, it's going to be due a week later. You guys will have a week to work on it. Thanks. One thing that you should keep in mind is that I'm looking for the answers that you got in class, not the answers that you got on Wikipedia. So I hope you took good notes, and I will be posting the recordings as soon as I can get to it. Okay. Questions? Any other questions? Okay, so that's for next week. All right. Then there's a couple other things. Today we finished our. Actually, Tuesday we finished our discussion on the Color of Money, and now we're going to do another discussion starting today on a video called the Two Coasts of China. This is an old video. It was made in the early 90s or mid-90s. And so a lot of the stuff that it talks about having to do with what's going on today is really talking about stuff that happened before Hong Kong was returned to the Chinese. But the value of this is the events leading up to the 20th century. So you want to keep. You want to kind of pay attention to what's going on there, because we're going to start talking about the age of imperialism today. And the age of imperialism, essentially is the 19th century, so 1800 to 1900, basically. Right. So that's kind of this. This does a good job of explaining how that actually works in China. All right, Questions, Comments about that. Oh, and then also there's a quiz for this week there, too. Okay. So just so you know, that's like what we've always done before. Although that's wrong. I got to fix it because it's not supposed to be 200 points, it's supposed to be 100 points anyway. All right. Questions, Comments about anything. All right, I'm going to go ahead and start then. Now, one of the things that you should notice is that we're starting on a new module, which means that what we're talking about today won't be on the midterm. Anything from here on won't be on the midterm. It'll be on the final. Okay, so let's just take a look at. I've already got this up. Right, right. The age. Can you see the screen now? Yes. No, slide. Yes, yes, yes. Okay. All right, so now you see age of imperialism. 1. Nationalism. Positivism. Right? Yes. Okay, let's talk about nationalism a little bit. Nationalism. See all the flags? Those are all the supposedly the nations. Right. Nation. A nation is something that. The way that we understand a nation today is something that really comes about as a result of the Reformation. Because you guys will remember that the Reformation was a. One of. One of the consequences of the Reformation was that the Church lost its standing essentially in the lives of the people. But one of the things that the Church had done during the Middle Ages and earlier was that it had given the people a sense of identity. When you ask somebody in Europe in, say, 1400, what were they? They would have said, I'm a Christian. And of course, in 1400, there's only one kind of Christian that's before the Reformation, right? So that gives you a sense of who you are. It's a self identity, right? And one of the ways that we can know that that's true is that when the Spanish came to America, they knew that they came from Spain, but they didn't call themselves Spanish. They called themselves Christians versus Mexicans or pagans or whatever. Right? You understand what I'm saying here, right? So what happens then in the Reformation is that people, the Church no longer is able to sees the imagination of the people because of the warfare that results between different countries, different, I guess, royal or noble places in Europe. And so what ends up happening is that people begin to identify with their state, the nation state, right? So now if you think about, for example, Louis XIV of France called himself the state. I am the state, okay? But the French Revolution, what it did was it created the sense that everybody in France was French and altogether they were the state, right? So now the nation becomes the. Their identity comes from the fact that they're French. And how do they become French? Well, they all speak French, okay? And they all read the same language. Remember we talked about the vernacular and the importance of that. And they all occupy the same geographical territory, right? So the nation state then becomes a replacement for religion. And it doesn't do that just in sense of identity. It also does it in sense of ritual and in sense of allegiance and those sorts of things. You know, it's like if you think about, for example, when you go to the baseball game, right? What's the very first thing they do before they yell play ball? They do what? Do the national anthem, right? They sing the national anthem. And then we have patriotic parades and we have patriotic holidays and those sorts of things. And those are in essence, a replacement for what existed in Europe before, which were religious holidays and religious parades and religious songs and things like that. So we see then that nationalism becomes a kind of a replacement in terms of identity for religion in the west, right? And what's interesting about this is that the idea of the nation, the way that we think of it today is a European idea, right? So nobody in, for example, India or Japan or Africa or America thought that they were part of a nation, right? In the way that we think of a nation as a nation state, okay? That's something. The fact that pretty much everybody today lives in a nation state is a result of European imperialism. Okay, Questions? Comments about this? All right, so let's Keep going. So now there's a difference. Well, the question then is, how do you become a nation? How do you become a member of a nation? And the question then is, well, what is it that makes. Let's just say, for example, right now, and I want you guys to help me here. What makes a person an American in the United States? Why is America your nation? Is America your nation? Yes. We would say. Let's say that America is our nation. All right, well, why is it our nation? What do we have in common with everybody else in America? We were born here. Some of us were born here. I was born. Citizenship test, naturalization. Probably nobody here, nobody that was born here probably had to pass a citizenship test. Right? I think we're just throwing out different ways that you would be associated. Right, I know, I understand. But. But that didn't. But that's not the way it is. Everybody didn't take a citizenship test. So what is it that makes America our nation? We're here in the United States. Okay? We're here. But there are people here that aren't. They don't. They don't call themselves American. Neil Young says he's Canadian. Right? People. There are people here from other countries that, that say, I'm. I'm not from here. I'm from somewhere else. Right. But I live here. Okay? So that means that my nation is somewhere else. Right? So what makes America our nation? This annoying to you? It's an unanswerable. It's a. Well, the answer. Personal. It is answerable, but it has to be. It's going to be a very messy answer. Right. The answer to the question is it's a collective imagination. Right? Collectively, we all agree that this is our nation. Right. That's why, you know, one of the things about nation is that the original definition was that it had borders. Right? But since then, you know, we can apply nation nations to people who don't live within the same geographical area, like what they call Pan Africanism or the. The Jewish diaspora or the. Or the. The black diaspora or the Red Sox nation. Those are. They don't have a geographical location, but they all have something in common that causes them to declare themselves a nation. Right. But the main thing is that the concrete basis for that is always something that they made up. Right. You're not born a member of the Red Sox nation. Right. You get what I'm saying, that it's something that is made up. Right? So here's what's the interesting thing about nationalism, is that there really isn't any concrete basis for nationalism. But nationalism becomes a driving force in the 19th and the 20th centuries that nationalism becomes very powerful. Nationalism is, on the one hand, on the part of the British and the French and other Europeans. Americans are going to say, because our nation is better than everybody else's nation, we have the right or the duty the. To control other nations. Right, and even invent other nations. And then these other. These colonized areas will respond to that by saying, okay, well, we're a nation and we have rights just like you, so you don't have the right to dominate us. You follow what I'm saying? So nationalism will be part of the imperial project of extending European power around the world. But nationalism will also be the answer to that. You guys follow me here. So I just want to. I don't have a lot of time to talk about it, but it is very important, and we'll see some of that as we go on. Today we're going to talk about Mexico and Spanish America, and then on Tuesday we're going to talk about China and Japan, and on Thursday we're going to talk about India, and again, kind of a little bit about Latin America. We'll see how those different areas of the world responded to European colonialism with this new idea of nationalism that was what was actually imposed on them by the Europeans. Okay, does anybody understand what I just said? Do you get what I'm talking about here? When it comes to nationalism, it's complicated. Or do you feel lost? I'm sorry, it's just. It's complicated. It is complicated. It's complicated, right? But I want everybody to really understand the importance of nationalism. From first, I want you to understand the importance of it in terms of world history, but beyond that, I want you to understand that it's based on essentially nothing. It's based on imagination. All right? It's a created. It's a. It's a what they call a construct, an intellectual construct. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, Comments? So, for example, I can give you. I give you an example. You guys probably weren't around in 9 11, right? So, but here's an example. 9 11, the terrorist attack in the east, and here in California, we're all out. We're all outraged because of what happened in the east, because they attacked us, but they never attacked California, right? So what is it that makes us angry when somebody in New York gets attacked? It's nationalism. You follow what I'm saying? And that nationalism is. That relationship that I have with people from New York is entirely Made up, they could attack Mexico City and I wouldn't get that angry. Do you understand what I'm saying? So anyway, nationalism is that I want to just briefly say there's a difference between nationalism and patriotism. And the difference, it's again, very complicated and it's not really obvious because there's a lot of similarity. But in the end, nationalism says, I'm better. My nation is better than your nation or any other nation. And patriotism, on the other hand, says, my nation is worth my allegiance and I am willing to die for my nation. That doesn't make it better or worse than any other nation. It's just that I have allegiance to this nation. So that's the difference between patriotism and nationalism. Patriotism says I'll die for my country. Nationalism says, I'll kill you to take your country because I'm better than you are. Essentially. Right, that makes sense. Questions? Comments? All right, so I'm going to just leave that. I hope that if you have any questions about that, you'll ask me now. I'm going to talk. We're going to go back and we're going to talk about. We're going to continue our discussion from the Industrial Revolution. And when we, you guys will remember that one of the outcomes of the Industrial Revolution was imperialism. And that because of the military power that the Europeans. The military and the technological power that Europeans developed during the Industrial Revolution, the challenge of the 19th century was modernize or be colonized. So essentially what happened was that the Europeans started exploiting resources in other countries where they could. And the way that those countries could respond was either to be colonized, either to. To modernize, or to refuse to modernize or not modernize, fail to modernize and be colonized. And so we can see. We're going to look at a few different examples here. We'll see that, for example, today we're talking about Spanish America. And they essentially tried to modernize, but they were not able to. And then we'll look at China, which refused to modernize. And then we'll look at Japan, which was able to modernize but became an imperial power. Okay? So that's. All of that is as a result of the Industrial Revolution. Okay. But then also remember that the Industrial Revolution created less than ideal, horrific, let's say it that way, horrific living conditions for many people who we've already identified when we talked about the Communist Manifesto as the proletariat. Right. And Communism was actually one response to the. To the excesses of industrialization and laissez faire capitalism. And so if you guys, you guys can remember, we talked briefly, we talked about the Communist Manifesto, we talked about it kind of at length. It was written in 1848. The basic idea, the reason for the problem according to communists is because of the bad distribution of property. And so that the way to solve the problem was to do away with private property and have everybody pursue their own self interest and own, and not own anything, but own everything in common, produce everything in common for the benefit of everybody. This actually obviously is going to have, is going to engender a lot of opposition from liberals and industrialists because the basic idea of communism, the way that it was supposed to be implemented was that they were going to destroy the existing nation states, the existing liberal nation states, so that they could erect their own state. That's going to be then the response in many places that are industrializing it in the 19th century to the idea of communism that they don't want, they don't want communism because it takes away the, the, the ability to own private property and to have a liberal government. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. All right, move on. Now you, you may or may not have heard of Darwinism. If I say Darwinism, what is Darwin? Is it the belief that depending on your, I guess it's like race, you can be superior than other people. It's not based on race, but it's kind of like that. If you, the, the phrase that always is used in relationship with Darwinism is what the fittest. Survival. Survival of the fittest. Exactly. All right, so now where does that come from? Let's take a look at. Charles Darwin was actually a scientist, he was not a politician. And his interest in science essentially was to look into the fossil record to see how things had evolved into what they are how, or see how things were what they are. Now. His idea essentially was in opposition to the current idea which was that everything that exists was created by God and had always existed and unchanging. Right. And what he found when he looked at the fossil records in his voyage on the HMS Beagle was that there were changes, that there were species that no longer existed and that there were species that had changed over time. And so he came up with the idea of evolution. Okay, but the problem or the way that he explained the process of evolution was that evolution was mainly keyed to a change in environment. So let's say that there is a tropical environment which has all these species living in it. And then there's an ice age and a Lot of the species are going to die out, but some will survive, right? So that's the process of evolution, that some species die out in a change of environment while others are able to survive. Okay. Now when Darwin first observed this, he said that the reason why this group of entities was able to survive was because of natural selection. But the problem was that natural selection doesn't really mean anything except that somebody's selecting, which was not something that Darwin believed. Darwin didn't believe that there was a God with selecting who lives and who dies. He believed it was all done by nature. So essentially it was random. But this being the age of science. Dr. Rachel, other people took the ideas of Darwin and tried to apply it to other areas like society, like politics, essentially, right? And this idea of social Darwinism was proposed as a way of explaining what was happening in societies and in the world during this period of time. Because what they said was what their, their idea was that the change of environment that, that Darwin was talking about was the change from an agrarian society to a modernized society, from a feudal society to a manufacturing society, right? And that that change caused some people to not be able to survive and other people to survive. But what they changed was they said that what made the difference between those who died out and those who survived was that those who survived were the fittest. So that's why they call it survival of the fittest. The thing is that from that point of view, then if there's a change of environment, in this case from agriculture to industry, then the people who are able to survive, the group that's able to survive will be a stronger group than the group that was originally there. The way that they become stronger is that all the weaker members are gone. Right? So survival of the fittest means all the weaker members die out and the only ones left are the stronger members. Okay, well, this, the social Darwinist said, well, that means then that those people who can't make it in an industrialized society should just die. Just let them die. And if they die, then everybody that's left will be stronger and we'll be stronger, right? And they used that in terms of people in society, and they used it in terms of nations, right? So in terms of people, those people who were poor, living in tenements, couldn't survive and they needed help. Just let them die. Because if they die, then we'll be left with only the stronger. And in those countries that were not able to modernize, were not able to make that transition from, from, from feudalism to modernization, let them Die because all the countries that will be left will be stronger. Right. You guys understand what I'm saying here? There's actually a fundamental problem with that idea, which is it's on the slide, kids, the weaker are not going to let themselves just die just because one group is making it economically better than them. Exactly. So it's really interesting. Thank you, Aaron. It's really interesting that in a way, the Social Darwinists and Marx agreed with each other. The difference was the Social Darwinist said the proletariat is just going to die out. The poor people will just die out, and that leave everybody else stronger. But the Marxists said they're not going to die out. They're going to rebel and get rid of the system. Right. But essentially they believe the same thing, that industrialization is going to cause a major change in society. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Now, I have to tell you that there were a lot of very intelligent people during this period of time who subscribed to this idea of Darwinism, but it was never enacted as a national policy. And there's basically, I mean, two big reasons. The one reason we just explained that if you just let people suffer, it's going to cause social disorder. But the other reason is because it's just plain immoral, right. To just let your population die. All right, okay. So actually I should probably rethink that a little bit because there were places like in Soviet Russia and in China where massive amounts of people were allowed to die in order to implement the communist plan. All right. And then here's a little picture for you that you can. What about the Nazi. Without however many grains of salt you want. Well, the Nazis didn't, didn't actually. Their idea wasn't to let the. The Nazis ideas were more racist than having to do with weaker, stronger. Actually, if you think about it, if you wanted to exterminate the Nazis, the reason why was they saw them as under. Under. Under people intervention. Right. But if you think about them exterminating the Jews, that must mean that they were afraid of them. Right. So that can't really mean that they thought they were weak. Oh yeah. They thought that the Jews was like, okay, so the Germany to lose the war. Right. So that's why they saw them as they had power. Well, they thought that because they thought that, but they, but anti Semitism goes all the way back throughout European history. It wasn't just something made up by the Germans. Right. And the idea, the biggest idea was that the Jews were going to replace all the all the Orions, right? It's called replacement theory. You may have heard of that. You may have heard of some people in America marching down the street yelling, jews will not replace us. Yeah, but they're both good people on both sides. Let's talk about then positivism. Oh, I'm not going to talk about that. So let's talk about positivism. Positivism is probably something you may or not have ever heard of, but it is actually another alternative and a more acceptable alternative to the excesses of industrialization. The first Positivism, we've already kind of talked about it before when we talked about the scientific revolution. We said that positivism stated that science is an unending quest for truth, not influenced by culture or politics, that it's based on observation and reason. And it's just true. Okay? And the example we use is that 2 and 2 is 4. It doesn't matter where you are, what language you say it in, or what your culture or any of that is. Right? Doesn't matter who's king. Two and two is still going to be four. Right. So that's the idea of positivism being that we believe in what is observable. Okay? And that was very influential in many other fields, as we've already discovered how all these other different. All these other fields try to define themselves in relationship or in the language of science. And this is true of philosophy as well. Right? So there was a French philosopher, this handsome gentleman here, Auguste Comte, who came up with the idea of social science. He is the. He's known kind of as the founder of sociology. So if you ever had to suffer through that class, now you know who to blame. Right? But, but he also came up with this, a theory of government, or I should say his ideas were used as a theory of government, which becomes known as social positivism. Right, and social positivism, basically the. The basic rule is that social activities can be viewed as a controlled scientific environment. All right, and now let's think about this. What is the challenge of the 19th century? How about Alec B. What is the challenge of the 19th century? It's the very first thing I started with in this class today. I would think that it's the transition from monarchies to industrial economies. But that's not what I said. What I said was that every country in the world was faced with a challenge because of the growing power of Europe. And that challenge was something or be something. How about Oscar Lopez? Tell me, what is it? All right, let's see. Show of hands. Come on, let's see them. I don't see any ads. I don't think anybody's listening. Oh, modernize or die. Modernize or be colonized. Exactly right. Say almost twing thing. Okay, good, Very good. That's exactly right. You can take your hands down now. Okay, so now here's what we see happening, that we see that in order to modernize, you have to have an industrial economy, right? But we also know that the transition from an agrarian society to a industrial society is very painful. Took in England, it took 150 years and it was. There were generations of people that were absolutely denigrated, exploited, okay? Before they were able to come to some kind of social peace. Right? And so what social positivism says is that rather than just letting events take their course, we should scientifically manage these events. We can actually look at how people, we know how people react to certain things. And so we can implement policies that will lead to modernization without causing all the disruption and suffering that was experienced in other countries. Okay? So the idea here is that social activities can be viewed as a controlled scientific environment. That means that society can be scientifically managed to modernization. But in order to scientifically manage society to modernization, society must be managed by scientists. Right? So what I'm going to do now, and this was all leading up to this, we're talking about Mexico. And the last thing we talked about was the independence of Mexico and how they ended up with an empire and the emperor was executed the following year. And then they went through essentially 50 years of turmoil. Okay? So they started with one constitution, which was a federalist constitution. Then there was a revolution and there was a change to a centralist constitution. Then there was invasion by the United States, then there was invasion by other European powers. And in the end they ended up with something that looked like a liberal government. It had a constitution, okay? They didn't follow it, but they had it. Okay? And the people who actually ran the country, other than the man who was president, was this group of people right here. And we call them scientificos. Why do you think we call them scientificals? What does that mean? Because they're scientists. Scientists. Come on, you guys can guess that one. Scientists. Exactly. So here we have an example of a country that was an agrarian country, a backward country that needed to catch up, that needed to modernize or was face colonization. And they attempted to modernize using positivism. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this. So were they. All right, let me talk about. Were they social scientists or technological? They're they're technocrats, essentially. So they're people who are. Sorry, they're people who are experts in, say, education, experts in infrastructure, experts in labor, experts in manufacturing, things like that. Right. There are people who have been trained in these technical skills rather than just, you know, Abe Lincoln, the rail splitter, something like that. Okay. Does that answer your question? Yes, thank you. I guess. All right. Okay, so now let's go to. Let's talk a little bit about the turmoil that happened in Mexico after independence in 1821. Okay. What happens is that democracy does. The stable political institutions don't develop. Okay. The reason why is because whenever there's an election, whoever loses the election says the election was a fraud and they end up fighting it out. Okay? And this happens over and over in Mexico. Whoever is elected becomes. I should say to you later, we're on. Whoever loses the election will say the election was a fraud. And because of that, then it will eventually lead to the. If the loser is in power, they will refuse to leave power, and if they're out of power, they will attempt to gain power using military force. Okay? And so that's going to mean that democracy really doesn't work. Okay. The. You just had some chills when I just said because it was pretty disturbing. But anyway, centralists versus Federalists here. The question here is, are we going to have a government like a monarchy, where everything is ruled from Mexico City? Because the reason why we would want something like that is because when we had that, New Spain was very wealthy, very powerful, and there had a lot of wealthy people in it. Right. Versus Federalists, who are saying no, that the power should be distributed to the states. And they use as their model the United States. They say United States has a federalist government, and it works very well for them. The United States is now very prosperous, and so we should do what they do. And the divide between these two different groups was insurmountable. They couldn't work it out in the ballot boxes. And so instead what they did was they fought each other. And the idea eventually becomes that the way the Federalists are going to win is they kill all the centralists and vice versa. So it's a bloody mess, essentially. And in kind of evolving from that, but in kind of the same area is the conflict between conservatives and liberals. All right? Conservatives are going to be, again, centralist people in favor of monarchy, people who are in favor of the clergy and the military. And the liberals will be people who are in favor of local control, democratic government, that sort of thing. Okay? Now, the reason why we make this change between centralists and federalists and conservatives and liberals is, is because this issue essentially will be resolved after the intervention by the United States, and they will have a federalist government, which they still have today. Right? But then there's still turmoil between our controversy, conflict between the conservatives and the liberals. Okay? In fact, there's wars over that, wars over whether what kind of policies should be implemented by the national government. Okay? Questions? Comments? So far, you guys are whipping. So this doesn't lead to a politically stable country, right? And then in the middle of all this, we see actually the first, there was an intervention by Spain in the 1830s, right? And then there's an intervention by the United states in the 1840s. And then in the 1860s, France and Britain and Spain are going to. Are going to intervene in Mexico again. All right? But the outcome of this war versus Conservative, with conservatives versus liberals, is the triumph of the liberals and the creation of a Liberal constitution in 1857. Okay, 1857 is a. The 1857 constitution is a liberal constitution, and it implements liberal reforms. Right? Liberal reforms are going to include land distribution, liberal politics, divesting the church of its lands and its authority in the country. And that's going to lead to a war. Right? So this war between the conservatives and the liberals will be ongoing when these other countries, Spain, France and Britain, decide to seize a port in Mexico to force Mexico to pay its debts, because it obviously doesn't have any money. It's not making anything, can't pay its debts. Right? So. So what happens in that particular case? This is in 1861. What happens in that particular case is that Spain and Britain make a separate arrangement with the Mexican government. But. But France remains. And the reason why is because France has decided that it wants Mexico. It wants to control Mexico. And the way that it's going to do that is it's going to impose a monarchy. And the man that they choose to be the monarch is Habsburg, from the House of Habsburg. Maximilian. Maximilian. I was actually, I think, the cousin of the Archduke Ferdinand, who was the leader of Austria during World War I. But anyway, so he. So what happens then is that the Spanish and the British withdraw the French, then land troops, and there's a war between again. Now the French are being supported by the conservatives, and the liberal president at this time is this fellow Benito Juarez. And Benito Juarez essentially takes the government, puts it in a cart and flees north, and they fight a war between the French and the Mexicans for the next six years. Or five years? Six. Five. Five or six years. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Is this making sense or are you lost? You guys understanding what's happening here? Yeah, I understand. So there's politically failed country. In the end, there's intervention by foreign countries, and in that foreign country decides to impose a monarchy, the Second Mexican Empire. Interestingly, though, by this time, the Mexicans have developed some liberal consciousness. And so there's a war between the French and the Mexicans during this period of time from 1861 to 1867. Now, here's something that you probably don't know. Maybe you know, how many of you guys have heard of the Monroe Doctrine? Me. Yes. Anybody studied US History? One. Yeah, I heard. What is the Monroe Doctrine? Was it. Was it like the US Somebody tell me what it is. So basically, it's, have any European countries interfered with any or try to colonize or whatever? American? No, American. The Americas. Then the US Will go at war against. Americans will respond. Yes. Which includes South America. Well, it's not exactly that, but you're close. Okay. What it really was. What it really. It was like that. Because what was what Americans were saying was that the. In fact, the quote, I think, is the United States will view any new colonies, the establishment of any new colonies in the Americas as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States. So they didn't actually say they would go to war, but they basically said, keep your hands off the Americans. But here, in this particular case, we see a blatant attempt by a European power to establish a new colony in America called the Second Mexican Empire. So why doesn't the United States respond? The Civil War. Exactly. The United States was distracted at the time. Right. But here's the interesting part that you may or may not know about, and that is that after the US Civil War was finished, the United States sent an army to the border between Mexico and the United States led by Philip Sheridan. And then the United States sent a console to France to ask the king of France, Louis Napoleon, when are you leaving? Not are you leaving, but when are you leaving? And as a result of that, the French withdrew their military support for the empire. Okay. And as a result of that, then the liberals under Juarez were able to take control again. Right. You guys following me here? And Maximilian actually was executed. This is him in front of a firing squad. The ironic thing about that is that Maximilian was really a liberal, and he tried to implement liberal reforms, but he was never taken seriously by the Mexican people because he was an outsider. So it was actually Mexican nationalism that in the end caused him to be executed. Okay, questions, Comments about this? All right, so now what happens after that is Juarez becomes president again, but he has a bad heart, he dies. And there is a little bit more political turmoil there, but they continue to use the Constitution of 1857, right? And the Constitution of 1857 says that the, that the President can only serve one term and it's a four year term, right? So, so after Juarez dies, Diaz ofrio Diaz, this gentleman, Porfirio Diaz, was actually the general that won the Battle of Puebla, which was the battle I showed you at the end of the last lecture, which happened on May 5, 1862. Right. So the Battle of Puebla is a patriotic marker in Mexican nationalism. And Porfiry Diaz was a hero of that battle. Okay? And Porfirio Diaz was very much like Juarez. He was a liberal, his ideals were liberal. But what happens is that he ends up establishing himself as a president essentially for life. Okay? And the period that he rules from, basically from 1876 to 1911, is called the Porfiriato. Porfiriato, okay? And the way that he stays in power all that time is that every four years he has the Congress rubber stamp amendment to the Constitution that allows him to run again and he runs unopposed. Okay? So now here's the thing. The reasoning behind this from, from Diaz point of view was that Mexico was not yet ready for democracy, that Mexico had to be made ready for democracy. And that was the task that was set before the people who were put in control of the government, the scientificos, right? So the slogan of Diaz and the Scientificos in the beginning was liberty, order and progress. Liberty meaning that we're free from outside interference. Order meaning that we're free from political turmoil and progress meaning that we can become a modernized country because we have all the resources we need for that. Okay? But eventually what they realize is that democracy is a very messy situation. And so their slogan changes really officially from liberty, order in progress to order in progress. Order meaning that we're going to maintain order in the country, and because of that, we'll be able to make progress. The idea behind this order in progress is that Mexico isn't ready right now, but we're going to make it ready. And when Mexico is ready for democracy, we will leave office and Mexico will be a democracy. So the idea then behind the Diaz presidency, behind the Porfiriato, was that the government needed to keep control until the people of Mexico were ready for democracy. Okay? And the way that they Maintained order was through a federal force called the rurales. Right. Who were like a, like kind of like the federal federales today in Mexico. And the strategy that Diaz used was called bano paloma, which means bread or the stick. Right. If you obey, if you go along with what we're doing, you'll get bread and you'll be taken care of. Otherwise you're going to get the stick. You get what I'm saying? All right, so this is going to then continue through the last quarter of the 19th century and into the first decade of the 20th century. Right. The result of it is going to be the establishment of civil order. Mexico become the political turmoil that had existed before. The Porfiriato is calmed. Also, the economy is placed on a stable footing. They have stable currency. And so Diaz then will invite foreign investors to take advantage of Mexico's resources. The problem, Well, I should say it this way. Mexico in a sense was modernized because they were actually industrializing to a certain extent. They had railroads, they had factories. But all of the output from Mexico's economy ended up going to foreigners. For example, one of the things that was true in the early 20th century was that Mexico grew enormous amounts of corn and they exported that corn to other countries while Mexicans were starving. So you can see how even though the economy has become modernized, it hasn't really helped the people. It doesn't really do away with the suffering that modernization creates. And so what will end up happening is in 1910, a horrific decade long revolution in Mexico. All right? And we're going to leave it right there. We're not going to talk more about that. I did. I do want to just show you this one little clip that comes from an article about American copper mining, but this was in that clip. So let's go ahead and just watch it. Tell me if you can't hear it. 40 miles south of the US border, you can hear it. Empire in Cananea, Mexico. You hear it? An American Colonel William Green, owned the Cananea Copper Company. Mexican President Porfirio Diaz had enticed foreign industrialists to take advantage of Mexico's rich natural resources. By 1906, Cananea looked more like a company town in Arizona than a Mexican pueblo. The town's most prominent structure was not the Catholic church, but Colonel Greene's two story clapboard mansion. The Mineros suffered the same conditions as their countrymen north of the border. They endured segregated housing, lack of promotion, and even in Mexico, a dual wage system. The Americans were paid 3, the number 3 in dollars and the Mexicans were paid 3 pesos. The rate of exchange was 2 to 1. So automatically Americans for the same type of work got paid twice as much. Outraged by this oppressive treatment of their fellow countrymen, Mexican intellectuals and political activists began to organize. Cananea became a symbol of foreign tyranny. Senores Mineros, teach the American you are not beast of burden. The American who has displaced us with his legion of blue eyed blondes. Esteban Calderon. My father was a baker and he owned a bakery there in Cananea. But yet he was one of those liberal types and I guess he liked to play politics. He would sympathize with the miners over the conditions that tell them so. Over here they were a little place called Lori Plata where they used to plant their straggledies. Abran Salcido was released from prison in Arizona in the spring of 1906. He went directly to Cananea to join the labor organizers working in the mines. On June 2 that same year, the mineros went out on strike. They gathered to present their demands to company officials. Colonel Greene personally came out and talked to the miners and told them that he wanted to raise their salaries but that the president of Mexico wouldn't allow it, that he was asking them as a friend to go back to work. The strikers refused. Dressed in their Sunday best, they marched through the camp to gather supporters. Over 2,500 arrived at the company's lumber yard run by two Americans, George and Will Metcalfe. George had been warned the strikers were coming. The first thing that the two Metcalfe brothers did inside of the lumberyard was to turn on the the hoses that they had in case of a fire and they trained it on the crowd. This infuriated the miners, so they forced the doors open. The Tu Metcalf brothers shot apparently first into the air and then directly into the crowd, killing two or three of the miners. The miners set fire to the office of the lumberyard to smoke the Tumatkalf brothers out. They came out still shooting, and the miners killed them both. One of them was apparently killed with his own rifle and the other one was clubbed to death and stuck to death with miners candlesticks that they were still carrying during the march that they had. Once they had killed the two Metcalf brothers, the miners were met by a group of about 30 armed Americans headed by Green. And the shooting began again. By 4 o' clock that afternoon, Mexican troops arrived to put down the strike. They were joined by 270Arizona Rangers who had been armed at The Phelps Dodge mercantile store. The Rangers had violated Mexican law in crossing the border with arms. To avoid an international incident, they were hastily deputized by the Mexican state governor. By the next day, the strike had been put down. Once again, Abran Salcido and the other strike leaders were jailed for inciting a riot. My father was arrested and sent to prison. They never could prove anything. So he came to the United States and he says, I've had enough of that thing. In Mexico, 23 people lost their lives at Tananaya, 17 of them Mexican. The strike had failed. None of the striker's demands was met. But the Cananea strike would give birth to the first major revolution of the 20th century, the Mexican Revolution. In the end, Porfirio Diaz would be in exile and 1 million of his countrymen would lay dead. What do you guys think? Do you guys get why I played that video clip? Yes. Did you learn about the effects of positivism on Mexican society in the 19th century and its relationship to imperialism? Can you see imperialism in this clip? Yes, we saw imperialism in this clip, kind of. Well, let me just say it the other way around. Okay, where did you see it? Tell me. Well, I mean, the. My. Because there is. There is imperialism there, right? The strikes. No, united. The United States. Remember, Remember, imperialism is control. I gave you guys control over the nation's. The country's resources. Right? Right. Control of one country's resources by one country for another for the benefit of the mother country or the controlling country. Right. And as we see here, Americans are actually controlling the Mexican minds for the benefit of Americans. And the Mexicans are not getting any. They're not gaining from that. So that's imperialism. Right. You see what I'm saying? Although in this case, it wasn't by the Mexican. It wasn't by the American government. But the reason why wasn't was because the Mexican government actually allowed it. Right. Actually allowed private American businesses to take part in this. All right, so anyway, so that's where we're going to leave that for now. And then next week we're going to be doing. We're going to start doing the. The. We'll start doing China and in. And Japan, and then we'll have the midterm on Thursday. So that's what's coming up. Any questions or comments about anything. Don't forget there's a quiz. This needs to be done by next Thursday. And there is another discussion that needs to be done by next Thursday. There's a study guide. The video is up for the discussion Prosper. Yeah, I made it available just before the class. Have a great weekend. All right. Have a nice professor. Thank you. Thank you. Great seeing you guys again. I'm sorry. All right, you guys have a good one. It's great seeing you guys again. I'm not sure if attendance was taken at the beginning of class, but I arrived a few minutes late to the Zoom. I. I didn't call the role. Oh, okay. Okay. I was just making sure I was the attendance. I. I wasn't sure if you did it, like, at the beginning. Is that the only reason why you stayed around? That's why I don't do it all the time. Never know. Okay, okay. Just making sure. I also know when I'm gonna call the role. Wanted to say I looked up. I don't even know what I'm gonna call the rule. Generally. I looked up the role. Not the role, the lead. The guy. You looked what? I looked up that man, Diaz, and I saw a picture of him that was like, young, and he looks just like Stalin, I think. Yeah. Like with the stache and his hair and everything then. He does in a sense. Right. Well, it's the big stash. That's what does it. That's what does it. They were of the same era, actually, so. Oh, that makes sense. No, really? I mean. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Have a good day. Yeah. Well, you know, one thing, this is an interesting thing. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm going to tell you something else. That Mexicans. There was a. There was a controversy in Spanish America over identity. Right. And the question. The controversy was, are we an Indian nation? Are we a. Or are we in a European nation? And one of the things that the leaders of Mexico and other countries settled on was that they wanted to try to make themselves into European nations. And. And that's why they. They tried to emulate France and beneath. And Porfirio Diaz was actually a full blooded Indian from Oaxaca. And he. But he wanted to look white. He looks like a German general here. Yes. And so what? One of the things that he did. What? He would put. He would put milk on his face in the morning to make himself look whiter. Oh, wow. Well, I mean, it worked. I would have thought that he would have been like. Like from Spaniard blood or something like that. Yeah, the way he looks. Yeah. Or mestizo, maybe. But him and Juarez were both full blooded natives. Okay. It kind of looks like. I think I've seen, like, Hawaiian people that have tried to, like, change their look to look more. More even like the Japanese that you showed us where they. They. When they became imperialized or started becoming imperial power. They all dressed very European. Right? You're going to see that. You're going to see more of that coming up in the next couple weeks. Okay? All right. Nice talking to you. All right. Have a good weekend.

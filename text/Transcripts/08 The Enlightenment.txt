But I just have to, like, be in it. I don't have to do anything. So they take roll and so I speak Chilling for a bit. It's a history class. Sa Sam. Sa Sam. Freedom, Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom Sometimes I feel like I the motherless child Sometimes I feel like Motherless child Sometimes I feel just like I motherless child along way from my home being Freedom, Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom Sometimes I feel just like I almost done Sometimes I feel like I almost gone Sometimes I feel just like I almost gone Way from my home Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom I got a telephony my wisdom and I can call him out from my heart I got a telephone in my bosom and I can go around my heart Wanna be my brother I say brother I say father this is a skeleton which stands here before you Be all the nostrils and move the bones below the veins and the world's blood runs through this is the place that will always be the home Freedom, Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom. Do you guys like my song? Yes. Loved it. It's great to see all you guys, even though I can't. It was very freeing. That's a nice pun. You're gonna be good at dad jokes. Does anybody know why I played that song today? Anyone? Guess? Nobody wants to guess. The song was about what Freedom and from the church. Well, kind of what we're looking at today is what we call the Enlightenment. And the Enlightenment gives. It's where we get our ideas of freedom from, right? So when we think about democracy and human rights, and we think about, well, not necessarily human rights, but democracy and personal liberties, freedom of speech, those sorts of things come from the Enlightenment, okay? And one of the things that. Even though this is not a US History class, one of the things that we will find very interesting is that it was Enlightenment philosophy that was the foundation of the American system. And the United States actually was the very first political entity to enact Enlightenment principles as its basis for government. Okay? So it's important for us to know about the Enlightenment. All right? Any questions or comments? Anything I can help you with? It's good to see all you guys, even though I can't see most of you. Any questions at all? You guys know we have a discussion coming up on Thursday. And the discussion. You need to finish your analysis before the discussion. Not at midnight, okay? Because we need. You need to finish it before we do the discussion so that you can discuss. All right. Questions, comments about anything. Everybody's good. Everybody's on Track so far. Okay, it's good to see a good turnout here. Let's, let's go ahead and dive right in then and we're going to start going through this timeline again. I've showed you this timeline before and remember we talked about the Western history timeline divided into three sections, the classical, the medieval and the modern. And we're in the modern era now. In fact, all of our class essentially happens in the modern. And we'll recall that the, the Reformation. What was the Reformation again? Do you guys hear me? You're not looking at things, are you okay? What was the Reformation again? Somebody tell me, what is the Reformation really? Essentially the first thing we talked about after we did our little world tour thing. It's like. I think we talked about it last Tuesday or so and it was very. Or yeah, last Tuesday. And it was very important because it really shook the foundation, the social foundation of Europe. Okay. This was when the Spanish decided that natives weren't. Well, they said they, they couldn't be slaves. No, let me, let me give you. That's the encomienda system. Let me give you a clue, a hint. Okay, the hint is away from the church. Martin Luther. Martin Luther. Not Martin Luther King. He's not in this course. But Martin Luther Professor. Wasn't this the Western movement of Christianity into Europe? The widespread, like the spread of the churches? No, it's after that actually. It happens in the 15th century. Is it England removing itself from the Catholic Church? Well, you know, that would be part of it, except for the English one we haven't talked about yet. And it's a little bit different from the one we talked about that happened in 1517. You guys have heard of Martin Luther, right? Who's Martin Luther? Didn't he challenge the Catholic Church views? Exactly. He challenged the Catholic Church and he published his 95 theses. And the result of his rebellion against the church was what, what happened to the church? They became corrupted. They accepted bribes for salvation. Okay, well, they. That they were corrupt. But what happened after the so called Reformation? They broke up into like different. Yeah, exactly. So they broke up essentially between Protestants and Catholics. Right. And the Catholics were led by. Who was the leader of the Catholics? Who's the guy who was protector of the Catholics? We talked about his office. Anyway, we have also used his name before because he was the King of Spain. But what was his name? Nobody knows. I'm sorry, it was Carlos V. Right, Carlos V, he was the King of Spain, but he was also the Holy Roman Emperor. Remembering we said that the Holy Roman Emperor was the sword of Christian. I'm gonna. I'm. I know this is hard for you guys right now, but I want you guys to. To think about and remember the things that I told you, because everything builds on everything we've already talked about. So if you don't remember that, we're wasting our time here. Okay? So. So now Charles V was the Holy Roman Emperor. And you will recall that I told you that the Holy Roman Emperor was also the sword of Christendom. What does that mean? What's Christendom? Sword of Christ or sort of Christianity. Sword of Christianity. But what is Christendom? Remember we talked about the Empire of Christendom impact all Christianity. Right, Exactly. At the Empire of Christendom. Who is the Emperor of the Empire of Christendom? Christ. Christ. Okay, but Christ can't be the emperor on earth. He's not on Earth. So who rules the. The Church on earth is the Pope. Right. But the Pope, in theory, doesn't have any military power. And you need military power to protect things and to. And to spread Christianity. And so who has that? The King, The Holy Roman Emperor. Right. And that's what. That's what Charles is. So. So when the Church broke, the Protestants were opposed to the Catholics and the Catholics were opposed to the Protestants. And into this mix, if you guys will remember, we talked about. I know this is. I know, I'm just like bringing all this stuff up again like a bad dream. Right? But. But we talked about the three estates. Tell me about the three estates. What are the three estates? It has to do with medieval Europe, the social structure. Everybody's divided up into three different groups. What are the three groups? It was the peasants, nobles, and then the. Right. The clergy. Exactly right. So the peasants, nobles and the clergy. And we said that in this three estates, even though the clergy was the second estate, they actually dominated society. And the reason why was because they were the ones who were in control of salvation and the Church was unified. You guys are following me here. But if the Church is broken, that provides an opening for the princes, for the nobles. Right. The nobles take advantage of the Reformation to use leverage against the Pope over whether or not they would continue to be Catholic or Protestant. Right. So the rule of the time was quius regio eos religio, which means whoever rules chooses the religion. So if the king says, okay, we're all going to be Protestant, then everybody's Protestant. And if the king says everybody's going to be Catholic, then everybody's Catholic. Right. In the whole Kingdom, nobody gets to choose. All right? So that's something that comes out of the Enlightenment. But the point here, though, is that if you can, basically the princess can go to the Pope and say, look, you have to let me handle things in my own kingdom. Otherwise we're not going to be Catholic anymore. We're going to be Protestant. Right? So. So we see a shift in power from the church to the state. Okay. Which is the princes, essentially. Right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about all this. All right, so now, remember, also at the same time, well, a couple things. One was that if the Protestants. If I was a Protestant and you were a Catholic and we were living during this time, what would be my job? Would I be able to say, oh, well, it doesn't matter. It doesn't bother me that you're Catholic. I'm gonna go ahead and be Protestant. You can be Catholic. Does that sound right? Is that the way it was? No. If you were a different religion, you were the wrong religion. And my job was to either make you back into the right religion or kill you. Right. And that leads to all these religious wars. And the religious wars are fueled by the unexpected discovery of America. Do you remember what that. Why that was? Why was it that the discovery of America fueled the religious wars in Europe? Wasn't it because of the natives, the disagreement and the slave trade? No, it's not because of that. It's because of what they got from the New World. Which was what? Gold. They got a lot of. They got a lot of resources, value. Okay? So it was gold, silver, a lot of different things. Money, essentially. Right. And who got this money? Who was the king of Spain again? Carlos the Fifth. Who was the king of Spain and also the ruler of the Holy Roman Emperor. Holy Roman Emperor. Exactly. And so because of that, he was the sword of Christendom. And he used a lot of the money that he got from America to try to force the Protestants back into Catholicism, which leads to really over a century of warfare. Right? So we have Catholics and Protestants fighting against each other. And the problem with that is it's a religious war, which means that my. Basically the way I act toward you is you either choose my religion or I'm going to kill you. But what's the problem with that? When it comes to religion, if I try to force you into. To renounce your God, are you going to just say, okay, well, I don't care. It doesn't bother me, or are you going to be willing to die for that? You'll become a martyr you could become a martyr. Exactly. That's where the word martyr comes from. Okay, so what happens then is that these religious wars go on and on, and they're destructive and they're destructive of property and they're destructive of people, and there's no way to bring them to an end because you can't win a religious war. The only way you can win a religious war is to kill everybody from the other religion. Right. And that's not possible. And so what ends up happening then is that we come to a point when we get to the 17th century, and that's in here where these wars are going on and on and on and on and on. And there's going to be a group of men in, well, group of people, I guess I should say, in Europe who we're going to call philosophy, and you'll see that word here in a minute on the slide, right? Was like philosophers, right? But we call them philosophes, okay? That's French for philosopher. Okay? So anyway, the point here is these philosophers are going to become being aware of the. Of the conflict that's been surrounding them that has been going on for so long, and realizing that this conflict at the basis of this conflict is religion, Right. It's Christian religion, essentially, is people believing that God has told them to do these destructive things. Right. And so what these philosophes will decide is that the problem isn't Catholicism and not Protestantism, it's religion altogether. Right. They're saying this is what causes the problems in the world is religion. Okay? The problem with this really is that up until this time, the way that we knew what was true in the world was by what was true according to the Church. But now in the 17th century, we see this, this alternative way of understanding the world which we talked about last Thursday. Which is what, rather than faith? It is what we talk about Thursday. Science. Science, exactly. So what happens is the principles of science. These Enlightenment philosophers will take the principles of science, which you will recall. Science was to observe nature and record what it saw in order to be able to understand it. These Enlightenment philosophers will use the same methods to observe society. And so the way that you observe. What instrument in your body do you use to observe your eyes? Well, right. But where does it go? Connected to what? Your brain. The brain, Right. And what does the brain do with that information? Process it reasons. Right. That's why we call this Age of Reason, because we look at what's going on and our minds can process it and we understand it because there's A scientific basis for it. So one of the things that will happen, one of the results of the Enlightenment is that we believe, and I mentioned this to you last Thursday, we believe that the truth only comes from science. We can only trust science. Now, that's true as a, As a society. That's not true necessarily as individuals. Right? Many individuals trust many other things other than science. But culturally, our society is based on science. The truth is in science. Okay? That's why there's so much argument about, say, for example, climate. Climate change, right? People say, well, there's climate change and we have scientific proof. But then, you know, the oil companies pay some science, somebody who says they're a scientist to say, oh, no, we have other proof over here. Right? And so we don't know what to believe. You see what I'm saying? Because we don't know what to sign, what is scientifically true. You guys get what I'm saying? Because we're not scientists. That makes sense. Questions, Comments about this? All right, okay, so let's move on then. So basically, then, the main thing I wanted to point out here is that religious wars basically will feed into the Enlightenment and will use the principles that are developed, the intellectual principles that are developed during the scientific revolution. Okay? So basically, you know, people try to put a limit on the Enlightenment. They'll say it lasted from 1648 to 1810 or something like that, but it really goes from about the middle of the 17th century. And we're just now, in the last 50 years or so, seeing the kind of decline in the ideas of the Enlightenment. And I'll talk more about that here in just a minute. Okay. Questions? Comments about any of this, Professor? Was another precursor to the Enlightenment and Reformation. The fact that the populace also started to become more literate. Well, that was as a result of the Reformation. And yeah, that. What that. But I mean, wouldn't that be a precursor? Absolutely. That means that people can read, if people have to be able to read the Bible. But if they can read the Bible, what else can they read? Other stuff. They can read some radical guy like John Locke. Right? Here's something you guys should keep in mind as you're reading Locke, because it looks to you like it's old and stuffy. But Locke was an absolute radical for his time. He would make Bernie Sanders look like a conservative. Do you see what I'm saying? And all of these principles of the Enlightenment were far left, extremely liberal. Okay. For the time. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, Comments? Isn't he known as the Founder of modern liberalism. He's not a founder. He's one voice. We look at him because he does a good job of capsulizing. Capsulizing, is that right? Capsulizing the, the Enlightenment in a couple of different documents that he wrote. So that's why we're going to look at his writings. But there's, there's others as well, and we'll talk about them in a second. All right, so everybody's with me. Questions, comments about that. We're caught up now. We're ready for an enlightenment. Okay. Okay, so here, now here's some, some philosophs. These philosophs. There are. There's many of them. Okay. I put here, I put four. And there's a reason why. And you'll see why in just a second here. First is John Locke and his contribution to our enlightenment seeking is what we call popular sovereignty. Now, popular sovereignty means the people rule. Sovereignty means who rules. Popular sovereignty means the people rule. That's why we're free. We have freedom because we rule ourselves. Right? Okay. So popular sovereignty. And this was a radical departure from what had been the basis for the right to rule up to this point. Sorry about that, guys. Up to this point. Sorry. Was divine right. And divine right essentially means that the reason why the king gets to rule is because he has a mandate from God. And this is not. This is not. This is not confined to European thinking. This was basically the thinking everywhere in the world that the people who were rulers had some special dispensation or even might be physically different. There was an idea in Europe that royalty and nobility had different blood than peasants. You either had noble blood or you had common blood. You see what I'm saying? Now we know that's ridiculous because everybody, Everybody's blood is basically the same. Right? But from their point of view, that. That was how they. They derived their right to rule. The reason why, say, King Charles V was able to rule Spain and the Holy Roman Emperors, because he had, he had. He had noble blood and he had inherited that. Right. And the question really, that I'm going to leave you guys with here is, well, what did he. Who did he inherit it from, ultimately? Right. And you're going to find the answer to that in lock. All right. On the very first page. All right. Questions, Comments about this. All right, so then we already talked about. We didn't talk. I think we did talk a little bit about Newton last week. We talked about Newtonian physics and how Newton had written the book Principia Mathematica. And that that book established the basis for understanding the physical world, which is the science that we today call physics. Right. So you guys have all heard of Newtonian physics, but what was significant about the Principia Mathematica is it gives us an alternative way of expressing the truth. Okay? Up until now, the only truth that there could be was the truth that came from the church. Whether it's Catholic or Protestant didn't matter. Right? But now we have an alternative to that. Rather than the truth coming from God, it comes from our observation of nature. Okay, guys, with any questions, comments about this. All right, then here's a couple guys that you probably think maybe. Maybe surprised by. Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Right. Benjamin Franklin is. We consider him to be one of our founding fathers, but. But he was really a generation older than most of the founders. And if we were going to call him anything, we would have to call him a founding grandfather. Right. But what's interesting about Franklin was that even though he was an American and he never gave up his claim to being an American, he spent most of his life in Europe. He spent most of his life in England and then later in France. Okay. And he was very much in the circle of what we would call the philosophes, especially when he was in France. He was there with the. With the great thinkers of the Enlightenment period. Okay. And then Thomas Jefferson also, same thing. Thomas Jefferson was the ambassador to France. Thomas Jefferson actually was more radical than you probably think. Right. And one of the things that he did while he was ambassador to France is that is he participated in and contributed to the French Revolution. Right. When we'll talk more about this in a different day. But when the French were in response to the king, when the French were demanding that the king grant the Constitution, Thomas Jefferson was there egging them on along with other Americans. Thomas Paine, for example. Right. Okay. So again, we're going to talk more about that in a little while and not today. But the main thing to take away from that is that Thomas Jefferson was very much in. He was one of the world's most highly regarded philosophers, even though he came from backwards America. Right, you get. You guys are with me on this. Now. The reason why I had bring these two guys up is because these guys are also instrumental in creating the United States. In fact, what you can. I think that if you read carefully what we're going to read from Locke, you could probably say that Jefferson essentially plagiarized Locke in the Declaration of Independence. Right. Keep in mind also that Franklin was involved in that as well, all right, so what that shows us, then, is that at its founding, the United States was a radical political entity. It's almost like the. The Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution in 1917. And even in some ways, it could. We could say that it's a lot like Iran after the Islamic revolution. Right? Because what. What they have done is they have set themselves up in opposition to what the rest of the world thinks. You guys get what I'm saying? And that's where the United States was at its founding. All right, questions? Comments? The United States was so radical that it was seen as a threat to the status quo in Europe. And it was. All right, okay. Questions? Comments about this. Anything. Did this period give rise to the secret. Secret societies? You know, I don't know that much about them in terms of European history. I know that. That they already existed and they were used as the basis for politics in Mexico. But I don't know about. I couldn't answer that question. I don't know where they come from, but I'll have to look now because I've never had that question before. So I have to figure it out. Okay. I'm sorry. I couldn't answer your question to anybody else. All right, so let's take a look at some of the things that Locke did. Right. Okay. So the first one is a document that he published, a letter that he published in 1689, and 1689 is the year of the glorious revolution in England. Right. Now, I'm not going to. We're going to talk about that either today or Thursday. I'm not sure which. But the main thing here was that one of the main issues, one of the main conflicts in Europe and in England in the 17th century was religion. What's the right religion? The English had Henry, who broke away from the Catholic Church, but wasn't really a Protestant. And then we had other kings who were Catholic. But as time goes by, the people become more and more Protestant. So we have. And then we have Elizabeth, who is actually a Protestant. Right? So. So what happens is that. Or we had Mary then, who was a Catholic. And. And what happens is every time the. The sovereign changes, right? Because of qui regio eous religio, everybody's supposed to change, right? So they all become Protestants. And then the king comes along and says, okay. Or the queen comes along and says, we're not gonna be Protestant anymore. You're gonna be Catholic. If you don't like to be Catholic, then we're gonna kill you. That was Mary. What do you think we Call. What do you. What do you think we call Mary today? What do you drink on Sunday mornings? Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. Exactly. Bloody Mary. Why was she Bloody Mary? Because she killed Protestants. Right, okay. So. So this is a problem that's been ongoing in England and really throughout Europe during this period of time. And what Locke writes is a letter. And keeping in mind that Locke was not a Christian. Okay. Locke was what we call a deist. You can write that down if you want. D, E, I, S, T. Right. And a deist is somebody who believes in that there is a God and also believes that there is an afterlife, but doesn't believe that God has any influence on people's lives. Right. So the clock maker. Yeah, exactly. So the idea is that God made the world like a clock as a clock maker, and then he winds it up and sets it in motion, and then he went to Starbucks and had a cup of coffee. Right. And the clock just sits there and runs by itself. And he gives the people in the clock essentially the ability to know the truth by observing how the clock works. Right. So that's the basis then for believing that science is the foundation of truth. Right. Is that God gave us the ability to observe nature, and by observing nature, we can understand the truth. Okay, so the deist then believes in God, but doesn't believe in the Christian God. Right. And most of the Enlightenment thinkers believe that Christianity is superstition. Right. Remember we talked about how we call the Middle Ages? The Middle Ages. Why are they middle. What are they in the middle of? Ages of light or enlightenment? Two different ages of enlightenment. Right. So now we're living in an age of enlightenment. Now, there was one before Christianity, but in the middle was this dark age of superstition. Right. So Christianity is superstition. And what Locke does is he expresses the Enlightenment view in this letter concerning toleration, that, that Christianity is superstition. But because it's superstition, we shouldn't bother trying to force people to be one religion or another. Just keep government out of it. Right. Just keep government out of it. Right. And so that's what we call the letter concerning toleration. And that's going to be the foundation for what will later the American system, and also really most of the Western system, which is toleration. Toleration essentially means that the government doesn't interfere with your practice of religion. Whether it's stupid or not, nobody cares. You can do whatever you want. The government doesn't have any business being in your private life in terms of religion. Okay. You Guys, get what I'm saying? And again, this is incredibly radical because the government had always been in league with religion throughout history, in every place we know of. Okay? But now we're saying the government should stay out of it, right? You can be whatever religion you want, right? That makes sense to you guys? Questions? Okay, so the next one then is this essay concerning human understanding. And in this essay, the idea that Locke was writing about was, how do people come to be the people they are? All right, now you need to pay attention to this, because I can't do it on the board like I. Like I usually do. Okay? But the way that people come to be, according to Locke, let's go back first, and let's say, according to Christianity, when people are born, they are born with a stain on their soul, which is called a macula. Macula. M A C U L A macula. And the stain comes from original sin. And what that stain does is it prevents you from achieving fulfillment. Okay? The only way, in Christian ideology, the only way you can actually achieve fulfillment in life is by having that stain removed. And since you can't ever really remove that stain, then you need to have somebody that covers it up for you or stands in its place, and that's Jesus. All right? According to Christianity. I'm not trying to preach you, I'm just telling you what it is, right? So basically, then, you're hopeless in terms of fulfillment, whether it's fulfillment here on earth or fulfillment in heaven without Jesus. Right? You need. You have to have Christ. That's the basis then, for the Christian understanding. I. It's very simplified, very simplistic compared to, you know, way the theology goes. But for now, we could just say for our. Our sake, for our understanding, that's. That's the way that the Christians view the world and still, too, today. Right, okay. Questions? Comments about this. All right? But now, what Locke said in contrast, was that the. The human person isn't born with a stain. The human person is born with a blank slate, okay? Tabula rasa. Tabula rasa means blank slate, okay? So that's why, if you see the picture I put here with a chalkboard in the back, right? A slate is like a chalkboard, okay? And what Locke is saying is that when a human being is born, they are like a chalkboard that has nothing on it. They're a blank slate, okay? And that what happens is, over time, their experiences write on that slate so that the people that they grow up to become or to be is actually shaped by their experiences during Their lives. Okay, so, so basically then, if you grow up in a society that, like Hobbes says, is nasty, British and short, right? Then you're going to become an adult who's nasty and brutish. If you live in a society where you have no freedom, then you're going to grow up as a person who doesn't value freedom. Right? It all has to do with the way that you're. The experiences that you. That you experience as you're maturing. Does that make sense to you guys? So now what Locke proposes is that if you can control the experiences of the human person, you can create the kind of person that you want. Okay? So what he's saying is, for example, if you, from birth, if you are able to control the experiences of a child, that. That shapes them, to be appreciative of liberty and freedom and intellectual curiosity and things like that, then you will. Then you will actually be able to create an enlightened being. Right? And if you have a society of enlightened beings, then you have an enlightened society. Does that make sense to you guys? Questions, Comments about that? Now, by what process do you think that you can control the experiences of a child? Think about this now. By what processes do you think that today In Southern California, 2021, the state can control the experiences of. Of the child through the education programs? Exactly. Through education. The state mandates what children are to be taught. Right. And what is the purpose of that? The purpose of that is to create the kind of society that we want to live in. Nice little cogs. Well, kind of. Right? So the main thing here isn't that, isn't that John Locke was proposing that people shouldn't be indoctrinated, but he was proposing that they shouldn't be indoctrinated in the church. Rather, they should be indoctrinated in these principles of the Enlightenment. You guys get what I'm saying? And that's what we still have. We see that happening today. Okay? All right. So anyway, so the point here then, and this really gets to the heart of the Enlightenment project, which is that if Locke is right and you can use education to create an enlightened society, then you can. Then human beings can. They can achieve fulfillment without God. That's why you don't need to worry about God, right? Because you can do everything that you need to do without God. So if you want to believe in God, that's fine, right? But it's got nothing to do with reality. You follow what I'm saying here? You guys are all with me. Questions? Comments? I hope. I hope that you're getting this, because this is fundamental, right? The. The fundamental outlook of Western society is that through liberation, through science and technology and. And education, we can achieve liberation and enlightenment through our own means, and we don't need God. Okay, guys are with me now. There's, you know, that's. It's also. We live in a society that's very fractured in terms of how that's understood. Right. But nevertheless, the basic understanding is that we don't need God to do well, essentially. Right. Okay, you guys are all with me on this. Questions, comments? Okay, then the last thing. And we're going to again talk about this on Thursday. The second treatise on civil government. The main thing that comes from that is the principle of popular sovereignty. Popular sovereignty, okay? And I told you already what that. What that means. What does it mean? Ruled by the people or the people rule? Exactly. The people are sovereign. Popular sovereignty. Okay, so. So now what we have at this point, and I want to do something here, I'm gonna. I'm gonna just write some stuff on a. On a word document, but I want you to. To. To go ahead and write these down. Okay? Oh, that's not what I want. Okay. All right. So do you see my word document here? There. You see my word document? Yes. Okay. Yes. So what I want to do is I want to write down classical liberalism. Okay? Now that's not liberalism. Like, we think of it in the United States. All right? Liberalism in the United States. We think of Bernie Sanders, maybe aoc, you know, even Biden to a certain extent, might be a liberal. Governor of California is a liberal. Right, but that's not what this means in. In terms of. When we. When we think about classical liberalism. Every politician in the United States who believes in the Constitution. I can't believe I have to say that now, but every politician in the United States who believes in the Constitution is a liberal, according to classical liberalism, because liberalism stands in opposition to, say, theocracy ruled by the church or by God, or say oligarchy ruled by a small group of people or monarchy or some kind of authoritarianism. Liberalism is essentially three characteristics, three things. All right? And the three things are. The first one is democracy, and the second one is secularism. What is secularism? It's when you don't use God as your religion. Right. In terms of government, it would be what. You're absolutely right. In terms of government, it would be what? Separation of church and state. Exactly. Separation of church and state. Okay, now have we achieved these Things yet in our class. Do you see where we talked about these things already and where they come from? Do you know where our idea of popular sovereignty comes from? Do we know our idea of popular silver and key culture from lockdown? Yes. Right. I've already talked about it. Comes from Locke. Right. When we think about popular sovereignty, the idea that we think about comes from Locke. Right. What about secularism, separation of church and state? Do we know where that comes from? Well, that also comes from lock. At least it was the idea. Yeah. We haven't achieved it in our class in any of the. Whether or not we've achieved it in reality is another story altogether. But these are ideas that drive us. Right. These are ideas that are found foundational for us. Ontological in a way. Right. Okay. So we know where our ideas of democracy come from and we know where ideas of secularism come from. Right, you guys are with me now. I want you to stop right there for a second and we're going to go to go back to the slide. You see the slide here? You guys can see my slide? Yes. Okay. And I should have done this before. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna take a little detour here. Right? And what I want to show you is this. This chart that I put together to kind of show us the distance that we've traveled philosophically from the Middle Ages. Right? So in the middle ages or the pre modern period, the foundation. The foundation of truth. You notice I put truth. Let's see if right next to it I put tm. What does that mean? Why do you think I put a TM there? Trademark, Right. But what is. Why do you think I put a TM there? So it's the truth based on who you're asking or who? Basically, yeah. The idea is we have a trademark on the truth, right? So in the pre modern period, basically the church had the trademark on the truth. And anybody that didn't say the church's truth was violating the trademark. Right. And now in the modern era, or I should say up until recently in the modern era, the enlightenment thinkers had the trademark on the truth. And if you tried to state some other truth, then you were violating the trademark. Right. I don't know if you guys realize this, but for most of the time that the United States has been in existence, particularly during the 20th century, religion has been viewed by popular by prevailing culture as well, I guess you'd have to say superstition. Right. There's always been this kind of. If you really want to be forward thinking, you have to think in terms of science, you can't think in terms of religion because that's old school. That's, that's, that's not, that's not where the truth is. Okay? So at any rate, the foundation of truth was in religion, the church. Basically, the basis of truth. How do we know what's true? Well, I know it's true because I believe it's true. Right, right. And so, so for example, if, if you were to ask why is it true? Why do you believe, if you're a Christian, let's say, okay, why do you believe that Jesus was born through a 15 year old virgin who never had sex? And you would say, well, I believe it, I believe it because I believe it. You don't have to have, you don't have to have scientific proof for it, you just believe it. Right? And then the, the language of the truth was in the Bible. Everything that the Bible said was true. Right. Anything else might or might not be true, but if it was in disagreement with the Bible, it wasn't true. Remember what talked about Galileo, right? Galileo said that the Bible was in terms of faith and morals was, was absolutely irrefutable, but in terms of science, it was wrong. And what happened to Galileo, do you guys remember? Okay, he got house arrested. Right, exactly. He had, he had to recant and he ended up under house arrest. Okay, so what we've done by the time we get to the 17th century, if we've made a shift in what the truth is from the foundation being science and then how do you know what's true is reason? What is reason? Again, it's my ability to observe. Right? My ability to observe and process the data. And the language of modernity essentially is mathematics. All right? So now when we look at this line, it's not like everybody woke up one morning and said, oh, forget about that religion stuff, now I'm going to believe in science. Right. It's a long process and it really, I mean there's, when we look at a chart like this, it looks like there was a star difference and there is, but only over a long period of time. Right? So, so what we see happening, say for example, in the last 400 years, maybe 300 to 400 years, is a movement away from the thinking of the Middle Ages towards this modern ideal. Right? And the modern ideal is what's known as the Enlightenment meta narrative. Okay, so let me go back then to the other screen. Go back to this screen. Okay. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to Write down here the enlightened. This basically is through science, technology, education, humanity will notice I'm using the word will, achieve liberation. Okay? So through science, technology and education, humanity will achieve liberation and enlightenment. But now think about this for a second. If we start off with a foggy understanding of science and we, as time goes by, get a clearer and clearer picture of science, what would you call that? Learning. Learning, right. What? Oh, okay, I'm just gonna say it. Progress. Making progress. Right, Progress. That is the driving motivation for the west over the last 300 years. Progress, right? The idea that we're moving towards perfection. Okay, now just think about this. That up until this time, nobody thought about progress. Progress wasn't something that anybody even cared about. Everything was like it was, right? You get what I'm saying here? And so here, this is one of the major consequences of the Enlightenment is we have this entire population of people in the west thinking that they're ultimately moving toward and actively participating in the creation of perfection through progress. Right? Just think about it, our ideas. When we think about, you know, just in the United States, we say, okay, well, back in the 1800, nobody had microwaves and say, you know, hot and cold running water and water heaters and cars and all this other stuff. That's progress. We've made progress since then, right? Because now our lives are theoretically better and easier because of the progress that we've made. You guys are following me here. You guys understand this, right? Okay, so now I just want to leave that here for a second and then we're going to go back. No, let me go ahead and talk about it now. All right, so we, we have this. We're driven by this idea that we are making progress, right? But if it's, if we believe, if the meta narrative says that through science, technology and education, humanity will achieve liberation and enlightenment, right? Well, how do you explain the 20th century? 20th century, the world was more scientifically and technologically advanced and better educated than it ever had been in history. And what did we end up with during the Middle Ages? Excuse me, during the 20th century, we ended up with the Western front, the atomic bomb, the Holocaust. Right? So after World War II, many people in the west, thinkers in the west, started to say, well, that's just not true. The Enlightenment meta narrative is just not true. That this idea that science, technology and education will lead us to paradise is just wrong. Let me just give you a good example. I don't know if you guys are familiar with this, and it might sound silly, but it's actually real. If you think about it, right? Do you remember from the middle of the 1960s there was a show called Star Trek? You guys have heard of Star Trek? Everybody's heard of Star Trek, right? But look at, look at the world that was created in Star Trek, right? Everything is technologically advanced and clean and white, and people aren't fighting with each other anymore. They're. They're fighting with the aliens because the aliens don't believe in democracy. And we have Captain Kirk flying around the universe trying to make everybody good Americans like. Like they are. You guys get what I'm saying? Right? So that's the vision of the ultimate end of the enlightenment project is this technological paradise, right? But, but in what we see happening is that all the elements of the meta narrative don't end up with Star Trek. All the elements of the meta narrative end up with apocalypse. And so why do you think that in the 1960s, popular culture was Star Trek, and in the 2000s, popular culture is apocalypse? What do you guys think, right? You see how we've lost. We've lost our faith in the idea of progress? Does that make sense? You guys got that? Okay, so at any rate, that's where we are now. That's what they call the postmodern world, right? So when you go on with your studies and you hear people starting to talk about postmodernism, that's what they're talking about. It's really not a thing. It's. It's the absence of a thing. It's the absence of a. Of a narrative that we live by. We used to have a narrative that we live by. Now we don't know what to live by anymore. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? Questions? Comments? All right, so let's go back to the slide set here. We're almost done. Okay, so now where are we at? Oh, here. Okay, now go back. Right, so we have the pre modern and modern, and. And now we have postmodern. That's where we are now. Okay, all right, I have to fix that slide sometime. Now, one last thing we need to talk about. We'll talk about this on a different day. Okay? So up until the time of the discovery of America, the basis for wealth was land. Okay? If you had land, you had wealth, and if you didn't have land, you really didn't have wealth. Right? And the result of that idea of wealth was that by the time we get to, say, the 16th century, the 15th 16th century, when the discovery of America happened, all of the land in Europe was owned by somebody, which meant that all of the wealth was owned. There was only a little bit of wealth. There was only a limited amount of wealth, right? And if you had wealth and you wanted more wealth, the only way you could get it was to take it away from somebody else, right? The only way you could get wealth was if. If I had wealth in land and I want more, I have to take it away from you. That's what drives all this conflict over land, right? Because if you have land, then you have money, but you can only get land by taking it away from somebody else. You guys get what I'm saying? All right? So. So that's what we call mercantilism. And that's kind of the ancient way of thinking about wealth. If you have. If you have land, you have wealth. All right? But now the. The discovery of America kind of threw a wrench into gears. And let me just show you here. This handsome fellow up here is Louis the 14th, the Sun King. We're looking at the Atlantic world in the 18th century. This is the same century as the American Revolution. And by that time, you can see that the Americas have been divided up by the European powers. So when Columbus sailed west and he found America and they discovered all this land in America, what had they found, according to Columbus, what was it that they had actually found? They found wealth. Exactly. This was wealth. Okay? And so what happens then is that because this is wealth, it is the ownership of it is achieved by. Is taken by the state, right? So basically, the land and everything that's in America becomes the property of the state. Right? And what you. And everything that comes from America has to go to the state. All right? So. So we see then, for example, that all these green areas are controlled by Spain. And Spain demands that all of the revenue from the green areas go to Spain. And the same is true for France and for England. Those are the major players. So we just leave it right there. Okay, so what we have here is called the mercantile system, or the Atlantic system, which is a closed trading system, meaning that if you're in America and you want. You're in Spanish America, you want to trade with Europe, you have to trade through Spain, right? So anything that's. That's produced in America in Spanish America goes to Spain. Everything that's produced in French America goes to France. Everything that's produced in British America goes to England. Right? But let's think about this for a second, because let's say that we have this little island here. The island is called Saint Domingue, or Today we call it Haiti. Right. And in the 18th century, the French had a very wealthy colony in Haiti called Saint Domingue. Right. It's also sense of Domingo. Right. But the. The French had a very wealthy colony there, and they produced rum. They actually grew sugar cane, and then they would change the sugar cane into rum and ship it back to France. Right. Because you could do a lot of different things with rum besides get drunk. Okay. And. And in the British colonies, there was a little colony here called South Carolina. And in South Carolina, they produce rice. Right. Lots of it. So they would grow lots of rice and they would send it back to England. Right. Okay. So now let's think about this for a second. If I'm in Saint Domingue, first off, what do you do with rice? Eat it. Eat it. What do you do with the rum? Drink it. You drink it. Exactly. Now, if I'm in Saint Domingue, do you think I like to eat? Everybody likes to eat, right? Okay. So wouldn't it. And if I'm in South Carolina, do you think I want to drink rum? Yeah. I went to high school in South Carolina. No, they actually do drink rum there. Right. But anyway, so wouldn't it make sense then that the people in Saint Domingue and the people in South Carolina would trade wrong for rice? Does that make sense? Right. But they can't because of the mercantile system. If you want rice from South Carolina, it has to go from South Carolina to England to France, and then back to Saint Domingue. And the same thing with the rum. The rum has to go from Saint Domingue to France to England and then back to America. So what's that going to do to the price of the rum and the rice increasing? Way up. Right? It's going to go way up. Okay. And. And who does that benefit? The kings. Right. It benefits the mother country. So the people in the mother country, the merchants and the royalty, the rulers in these mother countries, benefit. But what about the colonists? It hurts them. It hurts the colonists. Right. And here's what's really interesting about this, is that the reason for the colonists, the only reason that colonies exist, is to provide wealth to the mother country, which means that the colonists aren't really citizens. Right. And what we see happening is that the policies of the mother country are going to essentially be taking money out of the pockets of the colonists. Doesn't that sound right, make sense to you guys? Okay, so now what does Locke. How many people have started reading Locke? Put your hand up. Okay. What does Locke say? The Purpose of government is. I don't know if it was him or if it was Hobbs who said this, but at least in history class and in high school, I think he said that government worked for order. Maybe. No. Well, that may have been what Hobbs said, but what Locke said is that the purpose of the state is to protect private property. The purpose of the state? Yeah, because it was like in. In nature there wasn't. It was each person for their own right. And so the purpose was the people to get together to elect a government, and then the government was strictly there to protect the property. And if the government wasn't doing that, then you relieved it. Exactly. That's exactly right. What happens is if the. According to Locke, if the government is not protecting your property, but instead violating your property rights, then you have a right to get rid of that government because the government's not doing what it's supposed to do. Right. And that's the basis not only for the American Revolution, but for all the revolutions in the Americas, is this idea that the government exists to protect property and the government's not protecting property. You guys got that? Questions? Comments? Okay, well, let's move forward a little bit and we won't talk about this for a couple weeks, but what happens, in fact, kind of because of the discovery of America. Remember we said that there was now a new source of vast wealth to the Europeans. And remember we said that the Spanish actually used the wealth that they acquired to fight religious wars and eventually went bankrupt. Right. But later the French and the English are going to use the money to enrich themselves. And the result is going to be that Europe will undergo an interesting cash flow problem. They have more cash than they didn't know what to do with. Right. And so after they've invested in mansions and art and positions at court and things like that, and they still have more money than they know what to do with, they start to invest it in technology. Right? And technology will eventually lead to industrialization. And the result of industrialization. And again, we're going to do this a different day. Right, but the result of industrialization is that you don't need very much land to make a lot of money. Right? You only need enough land to put a factory on. And you can use that factory to make money. You can run it 24 hours a day and just have it produce money all day long. Right? Okay. So basically then the idea that wealth is limited goes out the window, Right? And instead the basis of wealth is no longer going to be land. It's going to Be capital. What's capital? Money. Right. Okay. And because you don't need very much land to make lots of capital, that means that the amount of wealth that's available is unlimited. The only amount, the only, the only thing that keeps you from acquiring more wealth is your willingness to earn it. Right. That it's unlimited, how much you can get. Right. So we're under the mercantile system. The king thought that they needed to control the product of the economy and keep it closed. Under this new system which we will call capitalism, the best thing to do is to leave the. Leave the economy alone. Laissez faire. Leave it alone. Governments stay out of the economy and what will happen is that the people who are the people who are free to do so will produce wealth for themselves and for everybody else, for the government. Okay, so the idea then, this new idea, this capitalist idea is we should just let everything go, let the economy go and let people make money, because when they make money for themselves, we can tax them and we get some of it too, essentially. Right? So that's going to be the shift to capitalism. And again, we're going to talk more about that on a different day. But the main thing to take away from that is go back to this, that the last element of classical liberalism is capitalism. Okay? So the. By now, today we, by the end of today, we have in place all of the elements of classical liberalism. Okay, well, why do we care about that? The reason why is because classical liberalism is what creates the world we live in today. Right? If we look at the kind of ideologies of the world today, they're all centered on classical liberalism. Either you want it, you have it, or you hate it. Right? But it's going to be the kind of standard that motivates every other ideology. And what's going to cost that is going to be European colonialism. Right? So, so anyway, I just want to leave it there for now that, that we have created the kind of driving engine for creating, for, for realizing the world that we live in today. Any questions? Comments about this? Are you guys following me here? Are you tracking me here? You think you guys got what I'm saying? Yeah. Anybody really? Does anybody feel lost? If you don't, if you don't want to say it out loud, you can just let me know. But if you do feel lost, let me know. I can try to help you. Okay? How many people are here? Let me see your hands. Good job, guys. I'll see you on. I'll see you on Thursday. Thank you, Professor. Thank you, Professor. All right, you guys have a good one. Thank you. Thank you. Good one, guys. Yes, can I get the code to submit a late assignment? I suppose. Thank you. Yeah, just a second. Let me find it. Okay, your name is. Are you there? Maya Edwards. Okay, and which assignment is it? The document analysis. The nature of the sources. For what? The sources. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So your number is going to be 700-94-6. Thank you. All right, have a good one. You, too. Hi, Mr. Cox. Yes, hello. So I just wanted to talk to you in regards to a couple of things. One, I've been wanting to meet with you during Wolverine time or. Sorry. Sorry. During your office hours. Sorry. During your office hours. Because I know there are some assignments that I do have missing. But me, myself, I've kind of just like. I've kind of been procrastinating, talking to you because of just sheer nervousness, I guess. But I just want to talk to you because I know that I do have some assignments that I'm missing. And I saw that on your late work policy. In order to turn in those assignments or in order to get some type of credit for them, I need to get a code from you. That's right. So I didn't know if there was, like, any way. Do you know what you're missing? I know I'm missing, I think, two or three of the writing tasks. Okay, let's take a look here. Let me just ask you. Okay. Did you do tossing tea and stealing dishes? I did do that one. Yes. Okay. Did you do the ottomans? I did not do that one. Okay. Did you do the nature of the sources? No, not that one as well. Okay. Are you should be. Are you working on lock? Yes, I'm working on that one. Okay, that's going to be done on Thursday. Right. So. So you're missing two then, it looks like. All right, let me just look at the. All right, so what's your name again? David. David Silva. All right, so I'm gonna give you two numbers, okay? The first one is for the nature of the sources Conquest document. All right? Okay. At 700947. 700947. Yeah. So just put that in the top of whatever you turn in. Right. Okay. And then the other one is going to be 700948. And that was for the ottomans. Sounds good. Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you so much. And then keep. First off, I'm not very intimidating, actually. Yeah, yeah, I can tell you. Talk to me. Talk to me. But secondly, try to do your best to keep up with the work. I know it's hard when you're not, you know, meeting in class and there's so many other things to do that are so interesting. Yeah, no, yeah, I agree. It was just. It was one of those things where you kind of, like, you see the work and you really want to get it done, but you're just kind of, like. I kind of just fell into a cycle of procrastination. Yeah. And that was the only thing. But now I'm feeling a lot better. I'm. I've been on top of my classes, and I just really wanted to talk to you in regards to letting you know that, like, I am invested in your class and I am going to do a much better job of staying up to date with all the assignments. Okay. Well, maybe you should try Procrastinators Anonymous. But they're. Their meeting has been postponed. Thank you, Professor. I really appreciate it. All right, I'll see. I'll see you on Thursday.

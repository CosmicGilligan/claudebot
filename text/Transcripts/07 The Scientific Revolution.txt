As sweetest any heart but you wanted me with silence. She blinded me with science. Help me when I'm dancing close to her Science. I can smell the chemicals Science, science sweetest any heart on me. She blinded me with science. She blinded me with science. When she's dancing next to me Science. I can feel her scenery stance. Now she's making love to you. There's a rake of motion the elements in harmony she underneath. She blinded me with science. Good heavens. Ms. Sakamoto, you're beautiful. Hey, I don't believe it. There she goes again. She's tidied up. I can't find anything. All my tubes are rising in heaven. Notes like white in oceans all a dream ocean. When she turned her eyes to the sweetest in the ocean the sweetest any harmony. She blinding her sight. She blinded me with science. You guys like my song? Have you guys heard that song before? It was great. That was a good one though. Do you know why? Why I played that song today? Anyone to guess the Scientific Revolution. Hey, that's great. That's good. That's good. Glad you picked it up. So, any questions or comments about anything? Welcome to the Thursday afternoon class. I like to see all your faces if I could. I know that some of you were probably still in your underwear. But I don't want to see that. But. But I'd like to see your faces if that's possible. But that made any impression on anybody. Let me just mention a couple things about running the meeting here. Is that I know that you guys put things in chat, but I'm not reading chat while you're. While we're in class. So if you try to ask me a question or something, I won't. I won't hear it or know about it because I can't watch the chat and say the lecture at the same time. Okay? So just. Guys know that if you have a question, just bring it up, raise your hand or holler out or whatever. Then we're going to talk about. We're going to begin talking about Europe today. And so today we're going to look at the scientific revolution. On Tuesday we're going to look at the Enlightenment, which is in some ways a consequence of the scientific revolution. And then. And then on Thursday we're going to be discussing the lock document, right? So I hope that you guys have. Are all on track with all that. Any questions or comments? You'll notice also if you look at our homepage, that I put a quiz up for this week for the. For the conquest of the new World and that chapter 23 or 24, whatever it is, and then, and then, you know, you'll have again, you'll have one of those every week. So any questions, comments, anything I can help you with? All right, so as I mentioned, we're going to start with the scientific revolution today, the Enlightenment, which is kind of part of the Enlightenment. And remember why we called the Enlightenment the Enlightenment. I don't know if you guys picked up on this. When we were talking earlier about the Reformation, and we talk about the timeline of Western history, which is kind of here a little bit. Right. And we said that there were three different periods, and the three different periods were the Classical, the medieval and the modern, and that most of our class happens in the modern. And we said the modern starts here at 14:53. Right. But then we talked about how the Classical age was an age of secularism, essentially, and kind of a more an earthly outlook on life, whereas the medieval, because it was the age when the Church was dominant in Europe, there was. There was less emphasis on life on earth and more emphasis on trying to get to heaven, because that was where your eternal destiny was. And so what ends up happening is that there were a number of things that had, that had been prominent in the classical era that were lost in the medieval period. Like, for example, during the classical period, they knew how to build domes and arches. But by the time we get to the beginning of the modern period, that technology had been forgotten. Right. And so this era also becomes known as the Dark Ages. All right? And what the idea is is that the knowledge disappeared, but the reality was that the knowledge was always there. It was kept mostly in monasteries by monks, but nobody thought it was very important because it was all about what living on Earth and people wanted to get to heaven. So. So it was called the Dark Ages. And then. And then it's also called the Christian era. And then finally it's called the Medieval or the Middle Ages. And does anybody remember why it's middle. What's in the middle of the Ages of Light? Okay, right, exactly. The two ages of Enlightenment. So the way that modern people philosophs. We're going to talk more about them on Tuesday. But the people of the thinkers of the Enlightenment look back on the Classical era as an era of light and the Middle Age as it is an era of dark. And then the Modern age is a new era of Enlightenment. Enlightenment. And that's why they call it the Enlightenment. Okay, but what it really means then is that the Enlightenment actually is a rejection of the domination of the church. Okay, we have to keep that in mind that Enlightenment thinking is inherently anti clerical. All right, you guys got that? Questions? Comments about this? All right, so, and one of the things you'll be able to see as we go through today and, and Tuesday and as we go on is that there is a, a conflict, an ongoing conflict, philosophical in a way, in Western civilization between science and faith, science and religion. Right. And, and that is as a result of the Enlightenment. Okay, guys, are with me. Questions, comments? All right, so now moving into the modern period and just kind of show you where we're going. We did already talk about the Reformation and we talked about the conquest of Tenochtitlan. And both of those feed into this era of religious wars. Okay. The way that they feed into it is the Reformation is about essentially denying the authority of the Catholic Church and breaking away from the Church and then the conquest of. And that leads to violence between what they call Protestants and Catholics. And the conquest of the, of the New World actually provides the king of Spain with a new source of wealth that he uses to prosecute wars against Protestants. All right, so, so there was, there was. So both of these things together create this era of religious warfare. Okay. And then in, during this era, and kind of as a result of this era, we're going to see thinkers in Europe. They didn't really call them scientists at the time, but that they were kind of proto scientists. Right. Thinkers in Europe will start to, will start to make observations about the physical world. And some of the reason for that is so that they can develop new weapons for these wars. Right. So, so one of the things, one of the, one of the main accomplishments of Galileo before we get to the solar system and all that, is that he was able to create a, calculate a calculator that would allow the people of Italy or the Catholics to aim cannons more accurately. Right? So warfare then drives this scientific drive. Okay. The scientific motivation. Okay, you guys are with me. And then as we're going to see, starting on Tuesday, that will feed into the Enlightenment. It's not the only thing that feeds into the Enlightenment, but the Enlightenment will actually take up the model of the scientific revolution and carry it forward in other areas of life. Now, I don't know if you guys are clear with what I'm talking about right now. If you're not, you can ask me right now. But hopefully as we go through, you'll see how this all occurs. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about anything? Everybody's with me. All right. Okay, so let's go back then and. Let's go back then and talk about science. All right? And this is pertinent to us today, particularly those of us who live here in the West. That's kind of an interesting observation or label, because the west isn't always in the west, right? But at any rate, the point is that there's this Western kind of outlook on life. And in this Western outlook on life, we hold as an object of faith that the truth can be explained through science. Right? And that if anything wants to have a claim to the truth, it has to have a scientific basis. So the only way I can know something is true for sure is for somebody to show me the scientific data. Okay, you guys are with me. So. So now here's an example. Let's say that. Let's say. I don't know if you guys. Well, you can't see anything in my calendar. I mean, in my camera. But let's say I had a glass of water, right? And I wanted to know how much the water in that glass weighs, right? So how would I do that? I would put it on a scale, and then the scale would tell me some number and I would believe that number because it's scientific. You guys are with me. But I really don't have any idea how the scale works. And I'm not sure whether the number's right or not. But I believe it anyway because it's scientific. Right? You guys are with me. So. So when you guys, like, for example, if you have a water bottle, it has little lines on the side, what does that do? It tells you how much is in there, right? How do you know it's right? You don't know it's right, but you believe it anyway because it's scientific. So it really shows us that in order for something to be true, it has to be scientific. Now, there are things that are true that we can't explain scientifically, but there is. Behind that is the. The sense that it's just that we don't have the right means of measurement. But if we could measure it properly, we would be able to explain it scientifically. Right? You guys are all with me. Does this make sense to you guys? Now this might. This might be a. This might be a shock maybe to some of you, particularly if you're. You're being educated in the sciences, because this is definitely not the way science looks at science. What we're doing is we're looking at science from a historical point of view. And there is actually a branch of historical discipline called history. Of science, history of science and technology. Right. So we're kind of giving you a little of an introduction to that. Okay. Today. Now, the way that we're going to do this is we're going to think about one particular scientific discipline that's called cosmology. C U S M O L O G Y Cosmology. Right. Cosmology essentially is the study of the structure of the universe. Okay. Cosmology means the study of. Of the Earth. Right? But, but cosmology and, and science essentially is the study of the structure of the universe. Okay. And, and prevailing belief in the structure of the universe going back as far as we can remember was in, in terms of human beings was that the Earth was the center of the universe because you could look up and see that everything's moving around the Earth. Right? And, and the Earth was flat because it's flat. Right. You can see that it's flat and that the Earth was immovable. Right. Immobile means it doesn't move. I mean, you stand up, you don't feel like you're moving. Right. So those are things that are, are things that we believe and know about. The people of the time, up until the Middle Ages or this era that we're talking about, believe those things to be true. And nobody had to be convinced of that. Everybody just knew that to be true. So it was ontological, you guys. Remember we talked about that last week. It was ontological. All right, Questions, Comments about any of this. Okay? So now what I'm going to try to do now is I'm going to try to. I'm going to try to show you a whiteboard thing here that I've got on my iPad, and I'm going to try to draw something for you guys because it's really. It's easier for me to explain it that way. Although I have to say that my drawing skills are suspect when it comes to this. Okay, now do you guys see a white screen there? Yes. Okay, now this is. All right, so what I'm going to do then, the first thing is I'm going to try and show you. Basically, if you look at the way the people, let's say in the Bible, thought about the structure of the Earth, what they believed was that the Earth was like this rock, right. And that the rock was in the middle of the giant water, right. And that the sky was a dome over the. The Earth. Professor, before you continue. Right, yeah. Professor, we're only, we're only seeing a word document the universe. Okay. Is it with me? Questions? We're not saying. But now. Hello, professor, it's going to give way. I think it's the time. Can you hear us? I don't think so. The. The Islamic scholars and the Greeks. Hold on a second. I'm gonna. We're not. We can't see it. We're not seeing it. And you can't hear us. You can't hear me. We can't see. Can't see. Okay, hold on a second. And I don't think you can hear us. Up in the chat. You can read the chat. He doesn't read the chat. Let me see. Well, he doesn't read the chat, though. It says your sound. I don't know why you're not hearing it. Can you hear us? Can you hear us? We can't hear you. Can you hear me now? We can hear you. It's one wave volume. We can. I can hear you guys. So can you hear me now? We can hear you. Can you hear us? I can hear you. Okay, before you couldn't hear us. So, yeah, earlier we were. I couldn't hear. But could you hear me? Yeah, we could hear you. The whole time. We were trying to communicate that we couldn't. I was trying to say that we were only seeing a blank Word document and there was no drawing on it. Yeah, that's. There was no drawing on it. No, that's. That sucks. Try it again. Maybe it just wasn't updating the. The stream. No. And it's just showing the first frame. This is. It doesn't really work. Right. Let me just. I've never really had any luck with this, but I. I can see what I'm drawing, so I don't know why you guys can't see it. Right. Or you. You right now, it's just your face. It's not showing the screen. So do you see the whiteboard now? No. Somebody say something. No, no, we can't see it. No, we can't see it. Okay, let me try something here. All right, now I can hear you. Okay, this one share. Do you see it now? Yes, yes. Okay, now it's actually. We can see you. It's moving and stuff. So that's good. All right, but now can you see me drawing? No, I can't see me drawing. Yeah, no. Do you see that? No, you don't see anything. Is this supposed to be a Word document? Yeah, it's just. It's just a white screen that I can draw on. Theoretically, I use like Microsoft Paint or something like that. That might work better than the Word Document. Yeah. You'll have to draw with a mouse, though, right? Or. Oh, you're on tap with those. Oh, it's actually good. Oh, well, let me just try and let's do. This is going to be weird, but we're going to give you a shot here. Let me stop. Let me stop the share briefly, right? Oh, that's not what I want to do. So I want to stop and share. And now I'm going to go back to this load up something called lucid chart. Sorry about this, guys. It's just like technology is too much for me. It. All right, now, you see, it's. You see it's green. It's got like, little stuff on it. Little squares. Yes. Like a graph paper or something like that. Yes. Okay. Okay. So now the way that. The way that I. The way that I described it before, I don't know if I can actually draw on this, but. Okay, okay. So what I described to you before, let's say that this is a. The way that the original, like the. It's not showing anything. What the heck is going on? All right, let's say that's not a process, right? What that is is the firmament of the Earth, all right? And what that means is that underneath here, it's not square, but there's this, like, kind of giant rock, okay? And this is called the firmament of the Earth. And the ancients believed that all this out here was water, right? But that the. That God had put a. A dome over the firmament, and that's where people lived, was inside the dome, right? Everything outside of this was water, right? So that's the original idea. Does that make sense to you guys? I know this is. It's not the best way to do this, but it's the only way I can think of how to do it, right? Does that make sense? You guys got that? All right, but now let's think about this, right? What we want to do is we want to create the solar system, right? And the way that we create the solar system is that we put. Let's say we just have this big circle, right? And then inside the circle, we put another circle. And then inside that circle, we put another circle, right? And what we're gonna then look at here is in the middle, we're going to put something, okay? And that's something in the middle, according to the ancients, was. Okay, we'll just say that's in the middle, right? The A. What's in the A is in the middle, all right? And I don't Understand? Anyway, so in fact, I. So they're perfectly concentric. Yeah. Okay, there we go. All right, now it's in the middle. All right, so now this a. In the middle is the Earth according to the, the ideas of the people who lived at the time. Right. And so this is called the geocentric. Geocentric model because geo is Earth, actually, in Greek. But at any rate, geocentric means the Earth is at the middle. All right, and then say this is Mercury and this is Earth, and this is Mars. All right, so let's just put some, some more, little arrows, some more little circles there. Right? We'll say this is Mercury. Mercury's really small. So we'll just make it like. All right. And then we'll make the Earth here. Oh, I mean, excuse me, we'll make Mars. This is going to be Mars. Right. And it's kind of awful, but we'll just go with it. And then out here is the sun. Okay, so. So the way the ancients thought about the, the structure of the solar system was that the, the Earth was at the center and that then all of the planets moved around the Earth and the sun moved around the Earth. And, and how did they know that? Well, they didn't really. They, they did some by observation and, and the church came to believe that it was true and they, they supported it biblically. Right. Although the Bible really doesn't talk about the structure of the universe at all, but they were able to infer from some things that it said in the Bible that this is, this is how God had made the universe. Right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments? So, so the deal here then is that by the time we get to 1500, the church believed that this was true, and therefore it was true. And if you didn't agree with it, then you were in violation. You were in conflict with the church because the church was the foundation or held the foundation of truth. You guys are with me. Questions. So if you deny anything that the church teaches, you're denying the church. All right. Okay. So, so now here's what. There's a problem with this. Okay, Let me just say first of all, that when you look at, if you're standing on the Earth and if you're standing on the Earth and you're watching Mars, Right. If this was all true, and these were all circles and they, and they were all. Everything was moving around the Earth at the same speed, you would expect that you could stand on the Earth and you could watch Mars make its rotation around the Earth and that it would move the same distance every time or every day. It would always be moving the same distance per day. Does that make sense to you guys? Because if it's, if it actually is centering the Earth, then that's what you're going to be able to see, right? The problem is that it doesn't work that way. What happens is that the, the Mars will actually be moving forward, let's say in its orbit around the Earth. But at some point, well, it starts to slow down and then, and then it actually stops and then it moves backwards and then it turns around and moves forward again and it continues on its, its merry way around the Earth. You guys get what I'm saying? So that little anomaly there, we're going to call it an anomaly where Mars doesn't do what you would expect it to do, but instead what it does is it slows down, it stops, reverses course, then stops and reverses course again. That's going to be an anomaly in the model that doesn't go along with the model. Right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? So here's what happened. They've known this for a long time because you can see it by looking at the sky, right? So what happened was there was a Greek scholar and his name was. Let me just, let me go to this one. Do you guys see the, the slide set now? Okay, so there's a Greek scholar named Ptolemy who lived in the first century, second century BCE or actually CE Common era, right? And he looked at all this and he made a mathematical model that explained retrograde motion. Okay? And the way that he explained it was that he said that, that Mars actually is on a circular orbit. Actually Mars is on a circular orbit that centers on an orbit around the Earth, right? So that when we're looking at Mars from Earth, you can see it move back and forth, right? But it continuously moves around this orbit. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? All right, so that solves the problem. But here's what's really interesting is that first off, it's more than just Mars. There's dozens of these things that you have to explain, right? But secondly, when Ptolemy wrote his book, the name of his book was the Almagest. He actually provided mathematical proofs. So, so what we, we can take away from Ptolemy is that it was mathematically proven that the Earth was at the center of the universe. Okay, you guys are with me. That sounds like scientific proof, right? Although there wasn't any science really at the time. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? All right, let's Move on, then. And let's look at here. All right, let's go back to this. There was a problem with the model, right? Even though they had scientifically proven that the model, that the Earth was at the center, the problem was that the only way to know when now is is by observing the sky. And this, the observations of the sky and calendar basically was based on the idea that everything rotated around the Earth at constant speed and constant direction. And we know that that's not true. So there was a flaw built into the calendar. And by the time we get to the 15th century, that flaw is so great that the Church really can't be sure when now is. And the reason why it's so important to know when now is because. Because of the church calendar. The church celebrates its calendar based on the. On the seasons and on the dates, right? And the different. Like, Christmas happens on December 25, and Easter happens on whatever day it happens. And you guys get the idea here that everything happened on a certain day, and that's how they knew when those things were supposed to happen. The problem was that they really didn't know anymore. They couldn't tell, right? And that was a real problem, because if the Church doesn't know when now, when, how can they actually know anything else? How can you believe that the truth, the Church is telling you the truth if it can't even tell you what day it is? Right. You guys. You guys got me. All right, so what happens then is that the Pope reaches out to a guy. His name is Nicola Copernicus. He's a Polish monk, but he's also a mathematician. And he says, I want you to work this out. I want you to figure out. I want you to fix the calendar, all right? And so what. What Copernicus does is he looks at this model. He actually builds a model, right? What's the Earth at the center? And he tries to figure out, well, why is the calendar broken? And then he has a mental shock, kind of like an epiphany. You guys know what the word epiphany means? It's like. It's like an aha. I get it. I see, Right? And what his epiphany was was, hey, let's take the sun out of the. I should say it the other way around. Let's take the Earth out of the center and put the sun at the center, right? And he does that. So when he does that, what we. What happens is that the model falls into place. So. So if you put the sun at the center and all the Planets moving around the Sun. That actually fixes the calendar. Not only does it fix the calendar, but it also fixes the problem of retrograde motion. I didn't mention what retrograde motion was, Right? Retrograde motion is when Mars moves backwards. Right? It solves that problem. Because what you see is. Let's see if I can show you this other chart here. Right? In Copernicus's model, you have the Earth here, right? The sun is center, and Mars is out here. Right. And you see that Mars is moving around the Earth. Well, actually, it's moving around the sun at a slower rate than the Earth is moving around the Sun. So when the Earth passes Mars, it actually looks like it's slowing down, even though Mars is continuing to go at the same speed. And then for a time, it looks like it's going backwards. And then. And then it goes back to the normal rate. You guys get what I'm saying? So that solves the problem. It solves the problem of, of the, of the calendar, and it solves the problem of the, the idea of the problem of the retrograde motion. Right? The, the big problem that we have now is, isn't it true that the Church says that the geocentric model is right, Is correct. Isn't that true? It is true. Right. So what do they think about Copernicus? Copernicus is now saying that what the Church says is true isn't true. Right. Let me just write this here. So, you know, this is actually called. What do I do this. This is actually called the heliocentric model, because helios is the sun heliocentric. All right, so now, but here's what happened, though. Copernicus, I mean, the Pope was really happy that Copernicus was able to solve this problem. So he didn't have any problem saying, okay, well, the Earth really is at the middle, because the Bible says so, even though it doesn't. Right. The Earth really is at the middle. And what Copernicus did was just come up with an idea that explains things. Right? But it's not real. It's kind of like when you look up in the sky and you see the Big Dipper, you don't really believe there's a dipper up there, but it gives you a way of understanding what's up there. And that's what, that's how the Church explained Copernicus. So basically, then the, the calendar was fixed, but the belief about the, the common belief about the center of the universe and cosmology wasn't fixed at all. All right, you guys Are with me. Questions, comments about this. All right, now we're going to move on from Copernicus. Oops. And we're going to move to another. Oh, by the way, he writes up what he. His observations in this book on the revolutions of the heavenly spheres. All right, now we're going to move to another scientist. Although Galileo was an Italian mathematician and he worked for the Duke of Tuscany, and his job was at one point to. To create, as I already mentioned to you, a calculator, that. Which, that would help people to aim their calendars with better accuracy. And not calendars can, sorry, aim their cannons with better accuracy. Okay. And the way that he did this was he performed a number of experiments. And the way that the experience went, he had an inclined plane that could be varied in angle. He had a ball and he had a beaker of water. And what he did was he would measure, he would. He would start the ball, he start the water, and he'd start the ball rolling, and he would measure where the ball had reached after certain periods of time. Right. And he did this at hundreds of different angles. He took thousands and thousands and thousands of different observations. And when he. When he. When he finished with those observations, he was able to come up with what we know as Galileo's Law. Right. Galileo's law says that objects in motion will accelerate at 32ft per second per second. Which means. I have no idea because I'm a. I'm a historian, not a scientist. Right? But what's important about it isn't what it. What it shows us, but that it's a law, which means that you can apply it everywhere. Right. That means that any object in motion at a given angle will always move at a certain speed and accelerate or decelerate at a certain speed. You guys got me here. All right, so what's important about that is that if you have a law, if you have a scientific law, then you can actually predict the future. Right? Because you know you can. You don't have to actually demonstrate something to know what will happen, because there's a scientific law behind it. All right, you guys follow me here. Okay, now, let's think for a minute. What was the difference between how Galileo figured out the Galileo's Law and the way that Copernicus figured out the heliocentric model? What was the difference? One was test. Did. Which one? Galileo. Galilei. Exactly. Copernicus. What happened to him was he had a flash and. And he then tried it out to see if it would work. Right. But what Galileo did was he did a number of observations and then from those observations derived what was true. Right, so, so that's why that is what we call the scientific method. Right. And that's why most people say that Galileo, many people say I should say that Galileo was the, the, the father, the founder of the scientific method. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, Comments? Okay, now let's go on with Galileo a little bit, because later what happens. Galileo, as I mentioned, worked for the Duke of Tuscany, but when he wasn't inventing calculators, he had other things in his mind. And at one point he got a hold of a new high tech device that came from Holland and it was called telescope. Right. And when we think about telescopes, well, what do you do with the telescope? Well, you look at the sky, right? That's what he, but that's not what he thought about. What he thought about was that if you had a telescope, remember he lived in Venice and Venice was a great trading city. And so that means that if you were to take your telescope and go to the top of the tower at St. Mark's Cathedral and point the telescope out to the, out to sea, you would be able to see which ships were coming in before anybody else. Right? And if that was true, then you would be able to kind of fix the market prices on certain different things that were coming in. Right? So basically then the telescope was used as a way to make money. Right? And he was very successful with this. The problem was that he also was a little bit too curious. And so what he eventually did do was what nobody in their right mind would do. And that was he pointed his telescope at the sky. And what he discovered from many different observations was essentially that Copernicus was actually right, that what Copernicus had said about the sun being at the center was really true. It wasn't just an explanatory structure or anything like that. Right? And he makes a whole bunch of observations and he writes these observations down in a little pamphlet called the Starry Messenger. The Starry messenger basically says that the Earth does move around the sun. Sun is at the center. And not only that, but the objects in space that we look at are not perfect spheres, but there's, there are flaws, right. And a number of different observations like that, okay, that's going against what the church says, but it's okay because he really, it was if he didn't really upset the church too much yet. Okay, but there was a, there was, he, he worked for the Grand Duke of Tuscany and he, one morning he was having Breakfast with his. With the Duke's wife, the Grand. The Grand Duchess Christina. The Grand Duchess Christina and the Grand Duchess Christina asked him at his breakfast if what he said in the scarring messenger was true. Did that mean that the Bible was wrong? Because keep in mind that the church says the Bible says that the Earth is at the center. Right? So now what he did was kind of a dumb thing because he not only said that the Bible was wrong, but he wrote it in a letter. And the letter is called the letter to the Grand Duchess Christina. Right, Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina. And in that letter, he said that in terms of faith and morals, the Bible was absolutely, incontrovertibly correct, but in terms of science, that it was wrong. And that's what got him in trouble. Right, but got him in trouble with saying that the Church was. That the Bible was actually wrong about science. And what ends up happening is that he goes on trial in Rome and he is forced to recant, meaning that what he has to say is that I once believed that the Earth moved around the sun, but I now realize that that belief was in error. Right. Excuse me? I. I once. Yeah, right, exactly. So I once believed that the Earth moved around the sun, but I now believe that. That. That that belief was in error. Okay? And so he didn't get killed or anything, but he was still held under house arrest for the rest of his life. At any rate, the point is, there's a story about how when he recanted as he's walking out of the room, if he is reported to have muttered, but it moves nevertheless. Now, whether that's true or not, we don't know. But at any rate, what happened was the Church shut down. Galileo shut down. Copernicus removed all of his books from the bookshelves, forbade that knowledge. And as far as the Catholic Church was concerned, the. The scientific revolution was over. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay. All right. So at this time, is the. The Catholic Church kind of like, would you say, like a dictator, you know? Well, the Church is the ultimate authority in Europe. Kings and princes have. Have authority, but. But their authority is under the auspices of the Church, Right? So if the Church says something is true, then the kings and princes have to enforce it. Does that. Does that answer your question? Yes. Okay, but that's a good way to. That's kind of a good way to segue into what happens next. Right? Because Galileo was shut down, and the Church essentially shut down the scientific revolution, but the scientific revolution went on, and the reason why was because not. The church was no longer in control of all of Europe. There were large parts of Europe that had broken away from the Church and were now ruled by Protestants, right? And in those places, the knowledge that Copernicus and Galileo had developed was able to be built upon by other scientists like Psycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler and there were many others, right? But eventually what ends up happening is that this study of the solar system, the study of cosmology, cosmology, ends up with the writing of a guy named Isaac Newton, right? Now, I don't know if you guys ever had to suffer through calculus, but he's the guy to blame for it. He's the one who invented the calculus. And why was. Because he wanted to try and figure out this. This, the movement of the bodies in the. In the. In the solar system. And he had. He just. He really discovered gravity. He didn't invent gravity, just so you guys know that, right? He didn't invent gravity. He discovered gravity. Okay? And he writes all this stuff up in a book called Principhia Mathematica, okay? It's published in 1687. And one of the things I hope you'll notice is that when we look at John Locke's books, his book is also published. Right. Within a couple years of this. Right? So that's where we can see the intersection between science and. And the Enlightenment. Okay? But we'll talk more about that on Thursday. At any rate, what happens, he writes his book, Principia Mathematica, and that becomes the foundation for knowledge, physical knowledge or knowledge of the physical universe. Right? So. So you guys have probably heard of Newtonian physics, right? Newtonian physics comes from this book, and it was the standard for knowledge all the way up to the 20th century. It changes with Einstein. Right. But we'll leave it right there for now. Any questions or comments about this? All right, now what we're going to do then is we're going to actually critique this scientific revolution a little bit. And the first thing we want to say is that there was a great concern among the scientific community in Europe to establish that science was not a threat, that science was an unending search for truth, unhampered or unhindered by culture and politics. Right. Why do you think that would be something they were so concerned with? Because. Or else they would be, like, persecuted by the church. Could be. Right, Exactly. That's exactly right. But that the church had been threatened by scientific truth, so they had tried to shut it down. Right. And so scientists come up with this idea that science is not influenced by politics and it's just true, right? So, so if you say two and two is four, that's true. There's nothing politic, there's nothing political about that. It's not Republican or Democrat, it's not Chinese or American. It's true in, in Antarctica and it's true on the moon, everywhere. It's just true. Right? And so you can't be threatened by that because it's just the way it is. Two and two is four, right? You guys follow me here. This is our idea about science. All right? Questions, comments? And so that's what we call rational reconstruction. The idea of rational reconstruction is this. The scientists research for objective truth, not influenced by a culture of politics, and therefore it is not a threat. And you can hear Galileo saying, am I right? You know, it's not a threat. I'm not threatening you by telling you the truth. Okay? The problem. And so that's the way we think about it. If you ever were, if you ever thought about, if you've been taught anything about how science progresses probably through your lifetime, the way that you think of it is that we start off with some knowledge that's not so good, and then we add other knowledge that is better knowledge. And as time goes by, we get more and more, we get closer and closer to the truth, Right? So we could say, for example, Columbine thought that the Earth was at the center, but Copernicus was able to realize that no, it's not at the center. And then Galileo was able to actually prove that and on and on. And then Newton was able to finally define the relationship between bodies in the solar system and all these different things, right? So it's an endless progress of knowledge. You guys get what I'm saying here? And, and that that really kind of protects the institution of science from, from criticism from the outside. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments, like this. All right, now we're gonna, we're gonna move into the 20th century. Now. We're gonna talk about a guy named Thomas Kuhn. I have a little video here. It's like four minutes long, but I'm going to show you that later. I'm going to talk about Kuhn's idea. Thomas Kuhn was a physicist. He taught at Harvard and he was assigned to teach a class that essentially was what he called Physics for Poets, meaning that it was a class about science presented to people who are not science majors. So to explain science to people who are not scientifically trained, essentially. Right. And in Order to. He starts to look at the progress of science. He wants to see how science actually progresses. And I. You can imagine that he was, you know, marinated in this idea that science is an unending search for truth and endless progress toward ultimate truth. But in reality, what he finds is that science is not like that at all. The progress of science, or the way that you can think about science is that science actually occurs in two different phases, right? Most of the time, science occurs in what's called the normal phase. Normal. It's normal science, all right? And normal science, basically what it really does, rather than to do scientific research and discovery, it really does puzzle solving, right? And what kind of puzzles does it solve? Well, say, for example, that cosmology. We're looking at cosmology, right? And we see our paradigm in cosmology is that the Earth is at the center of the universe, okay? So we don't ever question that. Instead, what we do is we set about using that, assuming that to be true and using that to explain other things. And that's why we end up seeing Ptolemy write a book that proves that the Earth was at the center mathematically, even though it's not. You see what I'm saying? Because he's working inside a paradigm. He's working inside a discipline. So everybody in the discipline, all the members of the discipline, all have the same assumptions, and they're all essentially trying to prove what they know to be true. To be true, okay? But what happens is that often when you're in a paradigm, you will start to notice anomaly, right? Remember we talked about the anomaly of retrograde motion, okay? Now, retrograde motion shouldn't happen if the model is correct, right? But if it's. But you can call it an anomaly. And by calling it an anomaly, you can say, well, it doesn't fit the model, but it's just because we don't have the right knowledge. If we had the right knowledge, we can make it fit into the model, right? But we still don't question the model. Does that make sense to you guys? But eventually what happens is that the anomalies become so great, so glaring that you have to throw away the discipline, you have to throw away the paradigm and start from scratch, right? And that's what we see Copernicus do, right? But now let's think about this for a minute. Copernicus is an outsider, really. He doesn't. He's not in this discipline, right? And because of that, he's able to come up with a very different idea of. Of how the Universe is structured, right? And. And he kind of gets away with it when he publishes his book. But when somebody actually goes to prove what he says is true, he gets a lot of. He gets a lot of opposition, right? Not him necessarily, but Galileo. Right. And so this is what creates the crisis. Right? The crisis is the anomaly can't be explained within the paradigm, so the paradigm has to change. Okay, but when the paradigm changes, who decides what's the new paradigm? Well, who funds science? The church? Well, at this time, yeah, the church funded science. Right. So if the church funds science, do you think they would have any influence over what's being researched? Right. In our day? Who. Who is the major fund? Who provides major funding for scientific projects? The government. The government, Right. So let's think about, for example, in World War II, right, the government funded research into nuclear weapons, right? So in fact, the invention of nuclear power, the invention of nuclear weapons was a direct result of politics and culture. You guys get what I'm saying? So this breaks this idea, that of this unending search for truth, okay? Does that make that make sense to you guys? And keep in mind now when we're looking at, for example, that at any given point in time, Ptolemy knew that what he knew was true. Copernicus knew that what he knew was true, even though it was different from what Paul Ptolemy knew. Galileo knew that what he knew was true even though it was different from Copernicus. Newton knew that what he knew was true, even though it was different from Galileo. And later Einstein would know that what he knew was true, even though it was different from Newton. And it goes on from there. Right? So basically, then, the fundamental truth, which is called the prime exemplar, the fundamental truth is suspect. There's no more reason to believe the fundamental truth than there is to believe anything else, because history shows us that the fundamental truth inevitably is challenged and discarded. You follow? I'm saying here, but here's. Here's where we run into our dilemma, I guess you could say, as a Western civilization, and that is that we're all convinced, in fact it's ontological, that what's scientific is true. Right? And I'm not going to argue that you could say that 2 and 2 is actually 5, right? Or anything like that, but scientific. Some of the scientific facts are actually unassailable, right? But there are fundamental assumptions about science, like, for example, that if we don't know the truth about something, we will know it eventually, right? That we can't support using reason. And so what we really have is Faith in science. You guys get what I'm saying? And that's why I say that science is the foundational philosophy of the West. Science is how we know. How we know what's true is true. But we really, by historical standards, don't have any. Have any real rational reason to believe that what we believe to be true today will still be true tomorrow. Does that make sense, you guys? That's probably a lot for you guys to wrap your head around. What do you guys think? So is it like. So what you're saying is, like, maybe someday there will be like a discovery that just changes, like the truth or something like that. Well, what we believe to be true. So. So for example, right now we have atomic theory, and we keep doing more and more research into the structure of the atom, and they've gone even deeper than that. But there's this, this underlying idea that the universe is made up of atoms. I can give you an example, right? An example comes from the 19th century when there was a belief, Newton. Okay? So Newton studied light. One of the things he did was he studied light. He invented the prism and those. But. But what? The nature of light is that it is a wave, but it is also a particle, right? Particle. Right. It's a wave, but it's also a particle, right? And that's not possible in Newtonian physics, right? Well, how do we know it's a wave? Well, the way we know it's a wave is because it comes at us from the sun. It travels from the sun to the Earth, but once it gets here, it has all the characteristics of a particle. You guys, what I'm saying? And so the way that, the way that Newton solved that problem was by imagining something called the ethereum, okay? And the ether was an invisible medium through which light could travel, okay? And that's why light was able to travel from the sun to the Earth, okay? So in the 19th century, people get the idea. Well, we're going to try and figure out. We're going to try and measure the ether and figure out how we can measure the ether, okay? And they did a lot of very expensive research, creating many, many expensive devices to try to measure the ether. And their conclusion was that the ether wasn't there. And so that throws Newton's idea out the window, doesn't it? You see what I'm saying? Do you see then how what we fundamentally believe to be true can be proven to be not true. Does that answer your question? I think it was. Who said, who asked that question? That was you. Does that Answer the question. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah, go ahead. I was gonna say, I think also the idea is that you should always be skeptical of the science. That is science to be skeptical. And especially wherever in modern days it's like, or in the past it was like, okay, it might be pushed out from the church. And so you should be skeptical of it because they're trying to find a specific thing that validates what they want. Now in modern days, it's, where is the science funded from? Why? Why is it being funded? And so you have to do. You got to be very skeptical. But that is the overarching idea of science, is to be skeptical and find the facts. And it's okay to be, to find that the facts have now been proven wrong and then move forward with the new facts. I, I agree with what you're saying to a certain extent, except that's not the way science actually work. Okay. I can give you a modern example. There's one scientist who has this, who has proof, apparently scientific proof, that the space was actually created 10,000 years before the, the pyramids. Okay. Yeah. But the archaeological community says he's completely wrong. He's bonkers. Right? Yeah. What's I know is Graham Hancock, I don't know, but they deny, they deny the, the proof. Right. And, and so why did they do that? Well, maybe they're right, but also, maybe it's confirmation bias. Right? You guys know what confirmation bias is, right? We already believe this to be true. So if you tell me, if you try to prove to me it's not true, I'm not going to believe you. Right. We see it all the time in politics. Right. But it's also there in science as well. Okay. And this is interesting, I'm glad you brought that up, because this. I didn't actually talk about this, but we shouldn't talk about this. You guys have all heard the phrase thinking outside the box, right? It's used in marketing a lot. It's kind of a buzzword in business where we're going to come up with some new idea, and the only way to do that is to think outside the box. Right? Well, what's the box? All right, the box in this case would be the paradigm. It was actually Kuhn who thought that idea up, you know, thinking outside the box. Right. Okay, but what is the box? The box is the paradigm. Okay? The paradigm contains everything that is known. It's the truth, the discipline. Right. And it really, not only does it contain all knowledge, but it also limits knowledge. Right? Because if it's in the box, we know it's true. We don't know what's outside the box. In fact, we don't even know the box is there. Right. How do we find out that the box is there? By running into the wall. Right? How do we know that our paradigm of the geocentric universe is outside? That the truth of that is actually outside of our knowledge? We have to run into the problem of the anomaly showing us that the model is wrong. So we have to run into a crisis. So in order for us to be able to think outside the box, we have to first understand the boxes there. And the only way that we can understand the boxes there is if we run into it. Right? You guys are with me. So you can't just sit down one day and say, I'm going to think outside the box because you don't know where the box is until you run into it. Okay, does that make sense or does that make things worse? Let me, let me show you this little. This might help you a little bit. I'm going to show you this little film here. How does science progress? We tend to assume that science progresses cumulatively with the frontier of science hoisted up on the shoulders of giants as it reaches ever upwards towards ultimate truth. However, in his seminal work, the Structure of Scientific revolutions, published in 1962, the American physicist and philosopher Thomas Kuhn proposed that this view of science was incorrect. According to Kuhn, science does not progress cumulatively. Rather, scientific establishments exist as distinct and incommensurate ideological systems which rise and fall just like dynastic empires as the sands of empirical evidence shift over time. Kuhn proposed that science is far from the paragon of rationality that we. One might assume, though it may use the scientific method which is of rational intent. Science largely operates by establishing certain axiomatic ideas which Kuhn referred to as paradigms. These paradigms are ideas or theories which are foundational to each scientific system and together with their devoted advocates, form what Kuhn called a disciplinary matrix. Over time, these paradigms become articles of scientific dogma with which all subsequent ideas must cohere or else face rejection. Thus, it is argued that science operates via a non rational method of seeking to justify new ideas with respect to old paradigms, rather than evaluating new discoveries exclusively on their rational or empirical merit. This fundamental discord between non rational justification versus rational discovery Kuhn referred to as the essential tension of science. And it is this tension which has so often resulted in scientific institutions admonishing dissidents even, even within their own ranks. For example, in 1934 the physicist Enrico Fermi was effectively ostracized from the field of theoretical physics, having been repeatedly declined publication for his now widely accepted theory of neutron decay. In the 1980s and 90s, the Canadian Archaeologist Jacques Cinq Mars was was relentlessly castigated by his peers for bringing to light the now accepted evidence that humans had settled in North America 11,000 years earlier than previously believed. And in the 19th century the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis was driven to a nervous breakdown and committed to an asylum by his peers for advocating that doctors ought to wash their hands so as to reduce the rate of infection related mortality in hospitals. These and other countless examples occur because science, just like every other human enterprise, is fraught with human frailty such as ego and avarice. Which as the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer once wrote, is why all truth must pass through three stages. First, it is ridiculed, second it is violently opposed and third, it is accepted as being self evident. According to Thomas Kuhn, the disciplinary matrix of the prevailing scientific norm will inevitably try to resist or suppress any evidential anomalies that are incompatible with its paradigms. Until that is that the anomalies are so conspicuous or great in number as to trigger what Kuhn called called a crisis for which the only resolution is a scientific revolution and a paradigm shift. As the physicist Max Planck once remarked, science advances one funeral at a time. And indeed the advent of scientific revolution often involves the death of old paradigms and their supervening ideas, a phenomenon referred to today Kuhn loss. Therefore, while science undoubtedly has its rational merits, one must remain cognizant of the fact that just as with all human endeavor, science is vulnerable to the non rational machinations of ego partisanship and ideological thinking.

I was going to say that that works perfectly for the example you gave earlier of a more modern one, which is the pushback you'll get if you're going against the current scientific scientific narrative that you know about the Sphinx and the age. What you're doing is you're, you're gonna get everybody riled up that's in the discipline, like in every college across the world because you're saying what we're teaching is might be wrong. You're not, you know, and so it's, it gets that huge pushback and then like the poor guy who ended up dying because he just wanted people, doctors to wash their hands. And they're like, no, what are you, stupid? That's stupid. You don't need to do that. Yeah, and he. And he knew, you know, in his head, he's like, this is 100% right. Why is. Why isn't everybody else getting this? And you can be driven crazy by trying, just trying to ask people to, hey, open your minds. This might be the thing. But yeah, I appreciate that comment. What I really would like to convey, I think in terms of this teaching is not that we shouldn't trust science, but that we should realize that there may be something about the foundation of our thinking that might be wrong. Just acknowledge that we could be wrong. That takes a little humility that most people don't have. But how many fights in the world are happening because somebody won't admit they were wrong? But at any rate, the other thing, just as a kind of a counter argument, is to say that it is good to be skeptical of new ideas because if we just believed everything that came down the pike, you would get way lost. Right? So I think that there has to be a kind of a mix between humility and skepticism in order to be able to advance intelligently. Does that make sense? At any rate? So that's my feeling at all. Any questions? Comments? You guys are all good. Somebody just left. You're not supposed to leave unless I say leave. Okay, leave. Live long and prosper. I'll see you Tuesday. Thank you, Professor. Have a good weekend, Professor. Thank you. It.

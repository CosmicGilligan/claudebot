Okay, let's unpack this. Imagine, if you will, a world that moved at the deliberate pace of, well, an oxcart, where your entire destiny was quite literally tied to the patch of earth under your feet. Right. And then, almost without warning, it feels like a seismic shift happens. Everything just accelerates. New kinds of wealth emerge from places no one expected, and the global balance of power flips entirely, just completely reshuffling nations from, you know, obscurity to dominance. It's not just a change. It's like the very fabric of reality for millions of people was suddenly woven anew. It's huge. What's truly fascinating here, and I think often overlooked, is how these transformations weren't merely economic shifts you'd see on a ledger. Right. Not just numbers, not at all. They fundamentally ripped apart and reshaped societies from the ground up, rewired political systems, and even altered how individuals perceived their own identity and their place in this rapidly evolving world. We're talking about nothing less than a complete reinvention of what it meant to be modern. That concept suddenly gained this tangible, powerful definition. This period isn't just pivotal, it's. Well, it's foundational to our contemporary global reality. And that profound reinvention that's precisely the heart of this deep dive. Today, we're plunging into industrialization and modernization, the invention of modernity. Our mission is to explore how these two intertwined, incredibly powerful forces essentially built the modern world as we know it. We'll pay particular attention to how Europe, which for centuries kind of lingered as a global backwater, you know, compared to the glittering empires of the East. Yeah, relatively speaking. Right. How it not only caught up, but catapulted itself into unparalleled global dominance. The source material we're working with, it provides an incredibly clear, almost surgical roadmap through this complex and utterly transformative period. Our mission today really is to distill the absolute core nuggets of knowledge from this monumental shift. We want to move beyond just the what happened and truly grasp the why. The why is key, exactly. Why these changes created such profound and lasting consequences for global power structures, for societal norms we still navigate every single day. We're going to trace that historical line connecting the dots from the slow, unchanging rhythm of agrarian life all the way to the relentless, dynamic behemoth of industrial society. You'll see that the seeds of our present were sown deep in this past. It's almost as if we're about to hear that iconic guitar riff and step right into the heart of the Industrial age. You know, like Pink Floyd famously put it, welcome to the machine. A fitting image. So let's begin our journey by looking at the world as it was before the machine truly took over. Where do we start? We have to go back. To really understand the magnitude of this transformation, we have to go all the way back to the Middle Ages to what we call agrarian Europe. Close your eyes and imagine it. The fundamental social and economic structure of life revolved around something called the fief. The fief? Yes. This wasn't just a plot of land you bought and sold, not like today. It was a comprehensive, almost self contained, miniature ecosystem. Each fief had a manor house. That's where the lord resided. A small village where the peasants lived. Vast fields stretching out for cultivation, and crucially, a church, the spiritual center, absolutely central. It was a complete world in miniature, really, designed for self sufficiency, often with very little interaction with the outside world beyond, maybe immediate neighbors. Precisely. And within this largely isolated fief, society was rigidly compartmentalized into what was known as the three estates. The three estates, okay. These weren't just social classes like we might think of them now. They were seen as, well, divinely ordained roles, each with a specific function. Got it. First you had the aristocracy, the nobles and knights. Their primary role was military protection. They were the warriors meant to defend everyone and uphold order. The protectors. Then came the clergy, the priests, monks, bishops, tasked with spiritual salvation, guiding people's moral lives and providing what little education existed back then, salvation and learning, such as it was. And finally, the vast majority, the peasants, sometimes referred to as obradores, which is a Spanish term literally meaning workers. Obradores, okay. Their purpose was singular, to labor on the land, providing all the food and material support for the entire system. As the name agrarian suggests, the economy was overwhelmingly agricultural. Most of the output, indeed most of the wealth, was directly tied to food production. So land and food were everything. Everything. And social mobility within this system almost non existent. If you were born a peasant, you pretty much died a peasant. That was the reality. What's truly fascinating, though, and a critical detail if we're looking for the seeds of change, is who was conspicuously missing from this neat three part system? Ah, yes, the people in the town. Exactly. Even in the Middle Ages, there were growing towns in these nascent cities, and in those cities lived people who just didn't fit the mold. Merchants, skilled artisans, members of powerful guilds. They operated that core feudal structure, right? They weren't lords, they weren't priests, and they certainly weren't peasants. Tied to the land, they operated outside the traditional power structure, yet they were accumulating wealth and influence, weren't they? They absolutely were. And as we'll delve deeper, you'll see that these very people, initially kind of overlooked by the dominant system, would become this incredibly potent nascent force of change. They started chipping away at and eventually dismantling this entire centuries old structure. They were the early stirrings of a different kind of power, one based on commerce, not land. Okay, so we have the fief, the three estates, and these townspeople bubbling up. What was the actual relationship like day to day between the lord and the peasants? Well, building on that, the relationship within this fief system was quite specific and in many ways complex. The lord controlled the fief? Yes, but it wasn't outright ownership of the land as we understand modern private property. Not like owning a house today. No, not at all. Nor did he own the peasants themselves. Not in the sense of chattel slavery. Instead, the lord held legal rights to their labor. Peasants were obligated to work the lord's fields for a set number of days each week, producing agricultural goods directly for him. Okay, so it's about labor obligation. Exactly. In return, they received the lord's protection, which was vital in a pretty dangerous world. And crucially, the right to use the commons. Ah, the commons. I've heard of that. What exactly was it? The commons were essentially shared lands surrounding the village. They were available to all peasants for activities essential to their survival. Grazing their animals, gathering firewood, maybe hunting small game or collecting wild edibles. It was a communal resource distinct from the lord's fields or the peasants. Small personal plots, absolutely essential for peasant sustenance and a cornerstone of their way of life. And this commons system, you're saying this is where we see a shifts start to happen, Something that leads us towards the modern world? Precisely. This is where a profound, almost subtle shift begins to take shape. Landlords, the aristocracy, they eventually came to a stark realization. They weren't actually making a huge amount of direct profit from the agricultural goods produced by peasant labor. In the old way, it wasn't efficient for making money. Not really. Not for generating surplus wealth. So they began to fundamentally alter the arrangement. And instead of demanding a specific number of days of labor or a share of the physical crop, they started collecting rent in cash. Ah, okay. Money instead of work or goods. Exactly. This meant the peasants gained more autonomy over their own labor and what they produced on their plots. They could work more efficiently, maybe cultivate different crops, keep the surplus as long as they paid Their rent. That sounds familiar. It is. This seemingly small change was a direct, recognizable precursor to the modern rent payments you and I might make today. It was a fundamental redefinition of the economic relationship between land and labor, really setting the stage for individual economic initiative and eventually wage labor. So even before factories, the economy wasn't purely farming. You mentioned manufactured goods earlier. How did that work? Right. In this pre industrial economy, despite the overwhelming agrarian focus, there was still a significant need for manufactured goods. This is where the cottage industry comes in. Cottage industry, okay. Essential items like hats, shoes, clothing, simple tools, even basic furniture, they weren't produced in large centralized factories because those places just didn't exist yet. So where did they come from? Manufacturing happened on an incredibly intimate, decentralized scale. A peasant family would often have a dedicated workshop right in their own home, their cottage. It was often a way to supplement their agricultural income, especially during the long winter months when farming was slow. Let's paint a picture then. Imagine a peasant family in rural England, maybe the father and his eldest son sitting at a handloom in their small cottage, meticulously weaving wool into sweaters. What was the result like? Well, the output of this cottage industry was characterized by a very specific combination. A small quantity of high quality goods at a reasonable price. Okay, break that down. Small quantity, Small quantity. Because you could literally only make one item at a time, patiently, by hand, using simple tools. It was slow, laborious work. High quality. High quality. Because each item was often custom made, tailored specifically for a local customer, maybe even for a neighbor or family member. You needed it to last, so craftsmanship mattered. And reasonable price. Reasonable price, yeah, because it had to be accessible to the local, often quite poor community. Sometimes these goods weren't even exchanged for money. They might be bartered directly for other necessities. A sack of grain, a few chickens, maybe help with the harvest. Wow. So bespoke, slow, high quality, local. Exactly. And that stands an incredibly stark contrast to the mass produced, standardized, lower cost output that was just around the corner. It's a completely different economic logic. Okay, now let's zoom out a bit. What was the big picture economic philosophy guiding states back then? Right, zooming out. The prevailing economic philosophy of the era was mercantilism. Mercantilism. We hear that term a lot. We do. And it wasn't just a set of policies. It was a deeply ingrained belief system. At its core, mercantilism held that all wealth belongs to the state. All wealth belongs to the state. Wow. Yes. This meant that the state, the king or queen and their government exercised strict, often suffocating control over virtually all economic activity. The primary form of wealth for a nation under this theory was believed to be land in its raw materials, alongside, crucially, a large treasury of gold and silver. So it's about national treasure. Absolutely. Every economic decision, from trade routes to manufacturing types, was viewed through the lens of how it would benefit the national treasury and by extension, the power of the monarch. Finite wealth, zero sum game thinking, and this mercantilist belief system that directly connected to the transatlantic trade and the colonies. Right, directly. Remember how colonies were strictly forbidden trading with any nation other than their specific mother country? Yeah. Only trade with England or France or Spain. That's mercantilism in full powerful action. It reinforced the idea that lords manage the land not for their own ultimate profit, or even the peasants benefit, but primarily as stewards for the King. The entire output of the land, crops, timber, minerals, ultimately belonged to the king. Its purpose, to bolster the state's national wealth and power. There was very little concept of individual economic freedom or generating wealth outside of state control. But you mentioned earlier, the lords weren't always getting rich from this. That's the crucial point. While the lords managed the land under this mercantilist system, they didn't always make substantial profits themselves from these fiefdoms. The agrarian economy, constrained by traditional methods and state control, wasn't really conducive to rapid wealth accumulation for the aristocracy. As time progressed, particularly in the centuries leading up to the main colonial era, many lords actually found themselves financially struggling. Their traditional wealth base was eroding in real terms. So they were land rich, but cash poor, maybe. Often, yes. And this created a crucial opening. Merchants who were beginning to accumulate unprecedented wealth from the booming, though still mercantilist controlled transatlantic trade with the Americas. Those townspeople again, those townspeople, they started to buy out these struggling lords, buying up their land, their titles, sometimes. This marked an early but incredibly significant shift in who truly controlled wealth. Moving away from the old landed aristocracy towards the burgeoning dynamic merchant class, the power of capital was starting to assert itself. Here's where it gets really interesting, then. This feels like the turning point. It absolutely is. The true spark of industrialization, the fuel for the coming revolution, was this massive, unprecedented inflow of capital generated from the discovery of America. All that gold, silver, sugar. Exactly. And consider the stark contrast. Spain, for instance, got incredibly wealthy initially, but squandered much of its newfound gold and silver on endless religious wars and maintaining this huge, unwieldy bureaucratic empire. But other European Powers, England, France, Belgium, Holland. They took a vastly different, much more commercially focused approach. How so? These other European nations focused intensely on establishing extensive, highly profitable colonial ventures, particularly in plantation agriculture. Okay. Sugar, coffee. Sugar, coffee, tea, molasses, rum. Huge demand. These weren't just subsistence farms. They were commercial enterprises on an epic scale, driven by global demand and tragically, often slave labor. And who was running these? Not the old lords. And here's the the people who were managing and accumulating this immense, unprecedented wealth weren't the traditional aristocracy. They were individuals from the thriving port cities and merchant towns. That burgeoning, ambitious and increasingly powerful class we called the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie. So the city merchants, the traders. Yes, they were the rising economic powerhouses, largely unbound by old feudal obligations, focused on profit and investment. So these bourgeoisie, they suddenly have all this money. What do they do with it? Well, having accumulated fortunes beyond their wildest dreams, they began to invest their newfound capital. Sure, they bought up vast estates from struggling lords, maybe acquired some coveted court positions, amassed spectacular collections of art to show off their status. Living the high life. Absolutely. But even after all that, they still found themselves with an enormous surplus of money. This surplus wasn't just sitting idle. It was actively seeking new avenues for growth, for more profit. And where did it go? A significant portion of it flowed directly into the development and refinement of new technology. Ah, technology. The machines. Exactly. This massive injection of capital, driven by the desire for even greater profits, didn't just fuel it ignited what would become the technology revolution, unleashing an era of invention unlike any before it. The money was there to fund the tinkering, the experiments, the scaling up. And this technology revolution, it starts mainly in England. It famously kicked off in England, particularly in the innovative intellectual hub of Scotland, actually. And at the absolute core of this entire industrial revolution was the invention, and crucially, the refinement of the steam engine. Steam engine. Alexander Watt. James Watt, usually credited with the major improvements, though others worked on it, too. Popular legends suggest Watt was initially trying to find a more efficient way to make Scotch whiskey. Makes sense. For a Scot, maybe. But his genius quickly transcended that. His improved steam engine, far more efficient than previous versions like Newcomens, created a machine that could perform the work of hundreds of people tirelessly, relentlessly, and with an efficiency never before imagined. It was a power source that could be put almost anywhere. Unshackling production from the need for rivers, for water power, or just human and animal muscle. Let's go back to our earlier example. The cottage industry. Sweater weaver. How does the scheme engine change that picture dramatically? Instead of one person with one hand loom painstakingly making one sweater at a time, imagine one steam engine, this roaring, hissing powerhouse, connected by belts and pulleys to dozens, maybe even hundreds of looms, all clattering away in a single building, a factory. Wow. This single engine could now power the production of enormous amounts of sweaters around the clock, nonstop, day and night, with workers operating in shifts. So quantity just explodes. And to total transformation of production capacity. A quantum leap. The sheer volume of goods that could now be created was simply unimaginable just a few decades prior. Suddenly, scarcity, at least in theory, could become abundance. And this technological leap, it changes what wealth is, right? It brings about a truly fundamental economic shift that profoundly redefines wealth itself. Under mercantilism, remember, wealth required vast land holdings and state control, right? Land and gold for the king. Now, however, capital, which is more than just money, its accumulated assets like machinery, factories, raw materials and the finances to acquire them, that became the new measure of prosperity. So you don't need huge estates anymore? Not necessarily. A factory owner could become incredibly rich with a relatively small footprint of land for their factory, as long as they have the capital to invest in the machinery, pay their workers and source their raw materials. This mobilization of capital into new forms like joint stock companies, allowing many people to invest, represented a radical departure. It allowed for unprecedented scalability and growth. It essentially broke the old zero sum game of wealth. So what does this all mean for society? This is the birth of capitalism. This monumental transition from land based wealth to capture based wealth gave powerful rise to capitalism as we understand it today. And Adam Smith, the seminal economist, he theorized about this new system. He argued it was driven by what he termed enlightened self interest. Enlightened self interest, meaning. Meaning that wealth was no longer limited or finite because you didn't need vast tracts of land, which are finite, to make money. The amount of wealth available was theoretically unlimited. Anyone, Smith argued, through their own individual ability, ingenuity and desire to improve their own lot, their self interest could potentially get rich. This was a revolutionary idea, challenging centuries of fixed social hierarchy. Anyone could get rich. That's the dream. I suppose that was the theory. It's absolutely worth a critical thought here though, because while Smith championed enlightened self interest as a potentially positive force, maybe even benefiting society through competition and innovation. Yeah. Karl Marx, looking at the harsh realities a bit later, would describe this very same drive as naked self interest, viewing it as inherently exploitative of the workers who didn't own the capital. Right. Two very different takes on the same engine. Very different. But the core idea for both, in a way, remained the same. Wealth was now theoretically unlimited and accessible to more people than ever before, Creating an entirely new, dynamic and often quite ruthless economic engine within society. And the steam engine didn't just stay in the factories. No, absolutely not. It ignited an equally profound transportation revolution. Steam engines were adapted and hooked up to vehicles, Leading to the rapid development of steamships and, of course, the iron behemoths of the steam train. Right. The railroads changed everything hugely. To truly grasp the monumental impact, Consider the famous Lewis and clark expedition in the United states starting around 1803. Yeah. Exploring the west. It took them a grueling year and a half to travel from pittsburgh all the way to the west coast and back. Imagine that. The sheer time, the isolation, the logistical nightmare. A year and a half. Okay, contrast that. Now compare that arduous journey to the transcontinental railroad completed just over six decades later in 1865. Okay. You could travel from chicago all the way to sacramento, california, in about a week. A week? That's unbelievable. It's an absolutely staggering difference in speed and accessibility. To put it in quantifiable terms. In 1800, the world operated at an average speed of perhaps 3-5 mph, maybe limited by roads, animal power, wind power at sea. Right. Walking pace or horsepace. By 1840, just four decades later, with reliable steam power on land and sea, the average speed of global movement increased to something like 25 miles per hour. Wow. That means the world became, in practical terms, eight times faster and effectively eight times smaller. It's like the globe physically shrank almost overnight. Information could travel faster, Goods could move faster, People could move faster. And the effect of that shrinking world, Especially for Europe, immense. Particularly for those European powers that industrialize first, they could now project their military, economic, and political power more easily, More quickly, and more reliably around the entire world. So reaching places like India, china. Exactly. Places that were once weeks or months away by dangerous sea voyage Were now reachable with unprecedented speed and efficiency, thanks to steamships and eventually telegraph cables. This shrinking of the world, enabled by the transportation revolution and backed by industrial might, Fundamentally set the stage for future global dynamics. The explosion of international trade and, crucially, the era of aggressive imperialism. Ironclad steamships could dominate coastlines anywhere. Okay, so we have this massive economic and technological shift. What did it do to the actual structure of society, the people? Well, with this overwhelming shift To a manufacturing based Economy, the entire social structure of society underwent a dramatic and frankly, often brutal transformation. We rapidly moved away from the centuries old feudal system dominated by lords and peasants, right, the three estates, and into a new industrial world. This new social order was primarily dominated by two entirely new distinct classes that hadn't really existed in the same way before. The bourgeoisie, the factory owners, the merchants, the financiers, who amassed vast wealth from the towns and commerce. And. And a brand new, never before seen class, the proletariat. The proletariat. The industrial working class. Where did they come from? The proletariat emerged primarily from the countryside. It was a mass displacement of people, peasants who were increasingly no longer needed on the land due to agricultural changes like the enclosure movements that fenced off the commons and increased farming efficiency. They lost their livelihood. They lost their traditional livelihood and access to land. They found themselves dispossessed and with few options, they had little choice but to migrate en masse to the burgeoning industrial cities. Cities. Places like Manchester, Liverpool, Lille, which were now dotted with these steam powered factories demanding labor. They fled into the cities. They flood into these new, often terrifyingly crowded and unsanitary urban centers with nothing but their bare hands and their willingness to work long hours. They'd been severed from the land, their traditional means of sustenance, and now they had to sell the only thing they had left. Their labor power. And what defined the relationship between these two new classes, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat? This is the core defining difference that starkly defined the new social structure and the new economic system. The bourgeoisie owned the means of production, meaning the factories, the machines. Exactly. The factories themselves, the incredibly expensive machinery, the raw materials and the capital required to put it all in motion. This ownership meant they received all the surplus value, essentially all the profits generated from the production process. Okay, and the proletariat? The proletariat, on the other hand, owned only their labor. They brought their physical ability to work to the factory floor, often for grueling hours, 12, 14, even 16 hours a day, frequently in dangerous, unhealthy conditions. And for that they got. For that they received a subsistence wage. Basically just enough money to survive. Enough to pay for the cheapest possible lodging in crowded tenements and to put the most basic, often inadequate food on a table. There was no safety net, no communal commons to fall back on like in the old days. So no work, no pay, no survival. Pretty much no work meant no pay, and no pay meant no survival. It was by its very nature an extremely exploitative system, often relying heavily on the even cheaper labor of women and children and pushing adult workers to their physical and mental limits for bare sustenance. And the output of this new factory system, how did it compare to the cottage industry goods? It was a direct, almost philosophical inverse of the cottage industry. Remember, small quantity, high quality, reasonable price, another handmade sweater. The factory system produced a large quantity of medium quality goods at a low price. Okay, let's break that down to large quantity. Large quantity. Because production could happen 24, 7, continuously, often with multiple shifts of workers just churning out goods relentlessly on a scale never seen before. Medium quality. Medium quality. Because goods were now standardized. Yeah, they were mass produced, often on assembly lines, eventually not custom made or carefully tailored. You weren't getting a sweater crafted specifically for you. You were getting a standard size, small, medium, large, off the rack, so to speak. Quality control might not be the top priority compared to volume and low price. Low price. Due to the sheer scale of mass production and crucially, the availability of that cheap, desperate labor, you had legions of workers competing fiercely for those subsistence level jobs, keeping wages down. So that's why today you can walk into a store and buy a cheap shirt in a standard size without thinking twice. Exactly. That mundane act is a direct legacy of this factory system. Something utterly impossible. Just a few centuries ago, mass consumption was born from mass production. Okay, let's unpack this even further. When we talk about modernization in this context, especially looking at the 19th century, it's probably very different than what people might imagine today, right? It's not just about iPhones and faster Internet. Not at all. It's a very specific historical concept. It wasn't simply about adopting new machines or faster processes back then. It was a much deeper, more fundamental, indeed a radical cultural, political and societal transformation. So what did it mean then, precisely? In the 19th century, particularly from about 1850 onwards, modernization became explicitly defined, almost universally understood, as to look like the West. To look like the West. Okay. This wasn't merely an esthetic choice or a loose collection of ideas. It meant a wholesale adoption of a specific societal, economic and governmental structure that emerged and seemingly triumphed in Western Europe and North America. And what did that package involve? It meant two core, pretty much non negotiable things. First, having an industrialized economy powered by factories, capital, mass production, the whole system we've just been discussing. Right, the economic engine. And second, crucially, adopting a liberal government. This comprehensive package, industrial economy plus liberal government, became the benchmark for what it meant to be modern on the Global stage at that time. Okay, liberalism, that word can mean different things today. What did it mean in this 19th century context? That's vital to clarify. In this context, liberalism was a very specific package of three distinct interconnected components that largely emerged from the Enlightenment and came to dominate this era. Okay, what were they? First, democracy, specifically understood then as moving towards one person, one vote. The idea of popular sovereignty, where citizens, though initially, let's be clear, often limited to property owning men, had a say in their governance through elected representatives. Right, Government by the people, in theory. Second, secularism. This signified the radical separation of church and state, moving away from societies where religion dictated law and governance, towards a more rational, scientific, or at least non sectarian approach to public life life. Okay, church and state separate. And third, laissez faire capitalism, the idea championed by Adam Smith and others, that the government should theoretically keep its hands almost entirely off the economy, allowing that enlightened self interest and free markets to drive wealth creation and efficiency without state intervention or planning. So democracy, secularism, laissez faire capitalism, that's the liberal package that was the core ideological package that defined liberalism in this period. And it's utterly fascinating to see how these three tenets combined became the enduring dominant political and economic model promoted by the west, shaping policies and nations right up to the present day, even with modifications and challenges. So which countries actually achieved this modern status by, say, the late 19th century, who successfully looked like the West? By the late 19th century, a fairly clear, though small group of countries were generally recognized as having successfully modernized. According to this definition, we're talking about the core of Western Europe, specifically Britain, France, Belgium and a newly unified Germany. They were the industrial powerhouses and largely operating under liberal governmental systems or moving strongly in that direction. Okay, the core European powers, the United States also definitively joined this exclusive club, especially after its bloody civil war, sort of solidified federal power and accelerated industrialization in the second half of the 19th century and anywhere else outside Europe and the US and perhaps most uniquely and surprisingly for its time, Japan stood out. Japan was the only major non Western nation to successfully and rapidly modernize in this specific way during this period. Only Japan. That's significant, very significant. And it's incredibly important to explicitly note countries that were not included in this modernized group at this time, despite their geographical location or historical significance. Places like Spain, Italy, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, China, they simply hadn't fully embraced or achieved the complete package of industrialization and liberal governance as defined by this ascendant Western model. They were seen as lagging behind or unmodern. So when we say looking like the west, it wasn't just about abstract stuff like economies and governments. It was visible too? Oh, absolutely. It extended profoundly to cultural aesthetics, social norms, education systems, and even military organization. If you imagine, say, a traditional Japanese samurai warrior from before the Meiji Restoration, clad in their distinctive armor and attire, deeply rooted in centuries of feudal tool, a very distinct image. And then contrast that with the Western style business suits, the frock coats, the bowler hats, the European style military uniforms, and the Prussian inspired military drills rapidly adopted by modernized Japan after 1868. Oh, okay, big change. You get a powerful visual sense of this comprehensive transformation. Adopting Western aesthetics from fashion and hairstyles to architecture and even musical forms, was very much a visible, tangible part of looking modern and signaling that you were joining the ranks of these newly powerful industrial nations. It was a complete overhaul from the factory floor to the way people dressed and organized their armies, signifying a commitment to this new global model of power. Before we get to the big dilemma this created, you mentioned agricultural changes helping cause the migration to cities. Can you expand on that? The agricultural revolution. Yes, that's another crucial foundational element underpinning this whole period. The agricultural revolution, which had been developing for a while, but really accelerated, goes back partly to the influx of highly productive crops from the Americas, especially the humble potato. The potato, really? The potato was a game changer in many parts of Europe. It could grow in poor soil, yielded far more calories per acre than traditional grains, and was nutritious alongside other American crops like maize or corn. And European innovations like systematic crop rotation using nitrogen fixing plants like clover, and better fertilization. Okay, farming got way more efficient, dramatically more efficient. These advancements allowed far fewer people to produce significantly more food with less land and less effort. As a result, the European population, which had largely been stagnant or grown very slowly through the Middle Ages due to famine and disease, began to grow rapidly, really taking off after the 18th century. But this new efficiency also meant that many traditional agricultural laborers became redundant. Fewer hands were needed to work the land, which leads to that surplus population you mentioned. Dickens writing about. Exactly. Charles Dickens, through Scrooge's infamous line and a Christmas Carol, captured that harsh reality. The idea that there was simply more people available for work, especially unskilled work, than there were actual jobs for them to do, particularly in the countryside, where agriculture was shedding labor. And that pushes down wages in the factories, too, right? Supply and demand. Absolutely. This massive pool of surplus labor drove down factory wages to incredibly low subsistence levels. Factory owners could easily replace any worker who complained or got injured with another desperate individual from the seemingly endless supply flowing in from the dispossessed countryside. So what did these displaced people do? It led to a massive, unprecedented wave of both internal and then international migration. Peasants displaced from their enclosed former common lands and shrinking rural job markets first moved in droves to those burgeoning, often chaotic industrial cities. We talked about Manchester, London, Paris, Lyon, Essen. Looking for factory workers, looking for any work, but finding conditions still harsh, work often scarce or intermittent, and urban life brutal and unfamiliar. Many then sought passage across the oceans to the Americas. Primarily to the Americas. The United States received huge numbers, but also Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina. This resulted in a massive wave of urbanization within countries and this incredible global migration throughout the entire 19th century, fundamentally reshaping populations, languages, cultures and geographies across continents. It was driven by this potent combination of agricultural change and industrial pull. Okay, so industrialization changes the economy. The social structure causes migration. What about the political side? How did capitalism change who held power? Industrialization and the resulting accumulation of capital had profound political changes as well. Capitalism, by its very nature of allowing wealth generation outside of just land, allowed more people, not just the hereditary landed gentry, to potentially accumulate immense wealth. The bourgeoisie again. The bourgeoisie, yes. But also potentially successful inventors, managers, professionals. This meant that wealth, for the first time in history on such a scale, was potentially accessible to a wider segment of society, although still a relatively small one compared to the total population. This created a new class of powerful individuals existing outside and often challenging the traditional aristocracy. And this brings us squarely back to that enduring golden rule you mentioned. Exactly. Whoever has the gold makes the rules, right? Think about the American revolutionaries. Again, figures like John Adams, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson. They weren't European style nobles, for the most part. They were primarily wealthy property owners, merchants, lawyers, plantation owners, men of capital, the nascent bourgeoisie of their time. Their wealth gave them influence because they held significant wealth. They were the ones who shaped the new government. Writing the Constitution, ensuring its structure, largely protected their interests, particularly property rights. And it's crucial to remember that when the U.S. constitution was first established, active participation in government, like voting or holding office, was largely limited to these wealthy property owning white males. Their wealth gave them the inherent power to define the rules of the new political system. It's a direct reflection of this golden rule in action. And how does Adam Smith's idea of laissez faire fit into this political picture? Well, Adam Smith's ideal of laissez faire capitalism proposed what seemed like a beautiful, almost self regulating theory that government should keep its hands completely off the economy. Let the market decide. Let the market decide. The idea was that the invisible hand of the market, driven by individual enlightened self interest and vigorous competition, would naturally regulate itself, lead to maximum efficiency, and importantly, prevent vast destabilizing wealth inequality. If one person or company got too powerful or charged too much, competition would supposedly arise to temper their power, ensuring a degree of natural balance. That was the theory. But you hinted earlier the reality was different. But here's where the reality often diverged quite dramatically from the theory. What actually happened repeatedly throughout the 19th and 20th centuries was that wealthy capitalists, far from truly advocating for a strictly hands off government across the board. Yeah. Often came to control the government, or at least exert immense influence over it, and used that power quite directly to protect and further their own interests. How so? Give me an example. So, while they might vociferously argue against government intervention, when it came to things like labor regulations, minimum wages, working hours, factory safety standards, environmental controls, or anything that would cut into their profits. Right. Get government off our backs. Exactly. They were often perfectly happy, even eager for the government to intervene when it benefited their industries. Things like protective tariffs to keep out foreign competition, massive land grants given to railroad companies, using state power, or even troops to suppress labor strikes or providing subsidies. So hands off for regulation, but hands on for help. Precisely. Think about the lobbying efforts of major industries today. Big pharma, fossil fuels finance. They often push hard for government policies, regulations or tax breaks that protect their profits and market dominance, while simultaneously resisting regulations aimed at consumer protection, environmental costs, or labor rights. The hands off plea often selectively applied only to limiting things that constrained owners, not to limiting government support for owners. That's a really critical point about the gap between the theory and the practice. It highlights the inherent tension. While capitalists often argue ideologically for a minimal government role, in practice they frequently leverage governmental power to secure their positions. And frankly, the idea of pure, truly unregulated laissez faire capitalism, if left entirely unchecked, would likely lead to an unconscionably brutal system. As history has shown, if people are literally dying of starvation, preventable disease and abject destitution in the streets due to unchecked economic forces and lack of any social safety net, it rarely ends peacefully or stably. Such desperate conditions often fuel widespread social unrest, powerful political movements demanding change, and in many historical cases, outright revolution. So governments have to step in, sometimes even in capitalist systems. Exactly this necessitates some level of government intervention simply to mitigate the worst excesses and maintain social order, even if it goes against pure laissez faire theory. Think about the massive government interventions during the Great Depression or more recently, the huge coronavirus stimulus packages worldwide. Governments pumped trillions into economies to prevent a complete collapse. Right? That wasn't laissez faire at all. Not even close. That was government getting deeply involved in capitalism essentially to save it from itself. A stark admission that pure hands off is often politically and socially unsustainable in the face of major crises. You also mentioned the rise of the middle class as an outcome. How did industrialization create that? That's one of the most significant and profound long term social outcomes. The increasing complexity of industrial machinery, the intricate logistics of managing large factories and global supply chains, and the need for new administrative and financial systems. All this made it necessary to have workers educated beyond just basic manual labor. You needed people who could read, write, do math, manage things precisely. These educated workers possessed specialized knowledge, technical skills, managerial abilities, administrative competence. This knowledge gave them a new kind of bargaining power that the unskilled laborers lacked. This led directly to the creation of a powerful new managerial class, sometimes called the professional managerial class or simply the middle class. These were the engineers, accountants, clerks, foremen, lawyers, doctors. Individuals needed to run and oversee the increasingly complex factory systems, manage distribution, handle finances, provide services. And they weren't owners. But they weren't basic laborers either. Exactly. They acted as a crucial, often indispensable link between the wealthy owners, the bourgeoisie, and the vast legions of laborers, the proletariat. They had better wages, more job security, and different social aspirations. And did this new middle class gain political power too? Back to the Golden Rule? In many contexts, absolutely. This newly empowered middle class, distinct from both the old aristocracy and the struggling proletariat, often eventually became the de facto ruling class, or at least the dominant political force exercising its economic and social power in accordance with that Golden Rule. Can you give an example? We saw this clearly in the United States, for instance, during the Progressive Era, around the turn of the 20th century and later during the New Deal. Middle class values, emphasizing efficiency, order, education, meritocracy, reform, heavily influenced government policy and shaped public discourse for a long time, especially in Western democracies. Politicians would actively try to present themselves as being middle class or champions of the middle class to appeal to this large and influential voting bloc. Interesting. But does everyone always vote for their own class interest? That's a great question, and not always. It's worth briefly mentioning the concept of false consciousness, a term often associated with Marxist theory. False consciousness. It describes a situation where the working class, or sometimes even segments of the middle class, might support political or economic interests that are actually contrary to their own objective long term collective well being. This might happen due to ideology, cultural factors, media influence, or a focus on short term gains over long term structural change. It illustrates a persistent disconnect that can exist between economic position and political alignment, highlighting the complexities of power dynamics beyond just simple class categories. Okay, wow. So we've got industrialization, new classes, capitalism, liberalism, global migration. Let's tie this all together. What was the huge dilemma this created for the world in the 19th century? Now, let's connect all these intricate threads to grasp the central defining dilemma of the 19th century faced by nations outside of that initial Western core. Right, for Asia, Africa, Latin America. Exactly. Europe's industrialization as we've seen, had created this unprecedented, almost terrifying surge in its military power. New weapons like breech loading rifles, machine guns, powerful artillery, ironclad warships, all mass produced in factories. A huge military gap opened up. A massive gap. Coupled with the transportation revolution, steamships, railroads, telegraphs, effectively shrinking the world, these industrialized European nations could now project their military, economic and political might globally with terrifying speed and efficiency. Efficiency. And they needed resources. And crucially, this industrialization created an insatiable, relentless need for raw resources. Coal, iron, cotton, rubber, tin, timber, oil later on, to fuel their ever growing factories, and an equally desperate need for new markets to sell the vast quantities of mass produced goods their factories were churning out. Their home markets couldn't absorb at all. So they looked overseas for resources and markets aggressively. So yeah. Therefore, non Western nations in the 19th century found themselves facing an undeniable, almost existential choice. There was really no escaping it. Given Europe's and America's overwhelming industrialized power and its rapidly expanding global reach, countries essentially had an implicit stark ultimatum. A fundamental choice had to be made. What was the choice? They had to either rapidly embrace modernization, which as we've now clearly defined, meant adopting industrialized economies and liberal Western style governance, legal systems, education, military structures, the whole package. Okay, option one, become like the west. Or option two, risk being subjected to aggressive imperialism. Imperialism. Meaning, and this wasn't just abstract theory, imperialism involved being directly exploited for your resources, being forced, often through military pressure or unequal treaties, into becoming a captive market for European manufactured goods, losing control over your own economy and often ultimately being outright colonized, losing your political sovereignty, having your culture suppressed and your destiny controlled by a foreign power. Wow. So Modernize or decolonize. That's stark. It was incredibly stark. Think about what happened to large parts of Africa and Asia during this period. The scramble for Africa, the carving up of spheres of influence in China after the Opium wars, the consolidation of British rule in India. Their inability or unwillingness for various complex reasons to fully modernize according to the Western template, left them vulnerable to this imperial expansion fueled by industrial power. And this brings us back to Japan, which he said was the exception. Precisely. Japan's decision, particularly during the Meiji restoration starting in 1868, to modernize so rapidly and so thoroughly, to consciously look like the west in terms of its economy, building factories, railroads, its government adopting a constitutionalbeit emperor centric, its military creating a modern conscript army and navy based on Western models, and even its cultural aesthetics and education system. Yeah, that was a remarkably strategic and deeply survival driven response to this very global power dynamic. It wasn't necessarily about loving Western culture. It was about gaining Western power to resist Western dominance. So it was a defense mechanism? Largely, yes. It was a conscious, sometimes painful choice made at immense speed and social cost, precisely to avoid the humiliating and brutal fate suffered by neighboring China and so many other nations that fell victim to European and American imperial expansion. Japan's modernization clearly highlights the intensely practical, even desperate aspect of adopting Western modernity in order to maintain sovereignty and self determination in a world that had been utterly reshaped and dominated by Western industrial power. It was the ultimate 19th century ultimatum laid bare. Modernize on our terms or be conquered and exploited on our terms. So we've journeyed together from that slow, quiet, agrarian world of fiefdoms where wealth was literally tied to the ground. Production was a painstaking art to this lightning fast industrial age, driven by the relentless power of steam, the accumulating might of capital, and the sheer volume of mass production flooding the world. This monumental shift truly did invent our modern world, didn't it? Creating unprecedented levels of wealth and technological advancement. Absolutely unprecedented. But also forging new, often brutal forms of inequality between classes and nations, and establishing a global power hierarchy that in many fundamental ways you could argue, persists even today. The core insight I think that you should really take away from this deep dive is that the invention of modernity was not some singular event. Not like a switch was flipped overnight. Right. It was a process, a complex, messy, often violent process. It was an interlocking interplay of economic, social, technological and political revolutions that fundamentally redefined what wealth meant, how power was structured, and how national identity itself was perceived on a truly global Scale for the first time, it wasn't just a historical chapter we can close. It was the prologue that set the stage for the entire world we inhabit now, with its interconnected economies, its dominant political systems, and its ongoing global challenges. So if we connect this to the bigger picture, thinking about today, I want you, the listener, to ask yourself, how does that stark modernize or be colonized dilemma of the 19th century continue to echo in our world? Hmm, good question. Maybe it's not in the explicit form of direct military conquest and colonization anymore. Not usually, anyway. But could it be present in different, perhaps more subtle, yet still powerful forms? Things like global economic influence, financial pressures from international institutions, cultural assimilation driven by global media, or even the current intense race for technological supremacy in areas like AI? Yeah. Is there still an implicit, maybe unspoken, pressure for nations, or even societies and cultures to conform to a dominant global model, whatever that model is today, in order to thrive, or maybe even just to survive and maintain relevance on the world stage? And beyond that specific dilemma, perhaps just consider this, reflect on it in your own life and the experiences you see around you. What are the enduring legacies of this invention of modernity right now, today? What should we be looking for? How do these powerful historical forces, that relentless pursuit of economic growth, the seemingly insatiable drive for technological advancement, the very structure of our current global economic systems, and the underlying power dynamics that still exist between nations and regions, how do all these continue to shape our present and profoundly influence our collective future? It's a complex, ongoing tension, isn't it, between progress, profit, power, and human well being. A tension born in this era that continues to unfold every single day.

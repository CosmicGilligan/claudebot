Have you ever paused to consider how entire nations, when they're confronted by, well, an existential threat to their way of life, you know, the terrifying prospect of being utterly left behind by a rapidly modernizing world, how they choose to react, the fundamental question, isn't it, do they dig in their heels, cling fiercely to tradition, maybe hope to just ride out the storm? Right. Or do they pivot? Do they embrace sometimes really radical change, transform themselves, often at an immense, maybe unforeseen cost? Yeah, the stakes are incredibly high. For some, it's about preserving centuries of cultural identity, the very essence of who they believe they are. But for others, it becomes this kind of brutal calculus of national survival, maybe even the pursuit of future power in a global order that's shifting under their feet. And that's exactly the dilemma we're plunging into today in the age of imperialism. Part 2. Our mission in this deep dive is to unpack this very tremendous challenge of modernization, that stark choice, that stark, often brutal choice, either rapidly modernize or risk being subjugated, maybe even colonized by these ascendant industrial powers, mostly from the West. And we're looking at two really fascinating but dramatically different case studies from the 19th century. China and Japan. Their responses to this aggressive Western expansion were just so strikingly divergent. You could almost cue the imperial march, couldn't you? It sets the scene. Empires vying for global dominance, power dynamics shifting across continents. Yeah, definitely. And while, you know, our previous deep dive touched on Britain as that kind of quintessential model of imperial power, today our focus is really firmly on East Asia. We're exploring how China's sort of entrenched resistance to outside influence, to fundamental reform, led to this profound humiliation, this loss of self sovereignty. While Japan's radical and, let's be clear, painful embrace of that same modernization challenge, not only let it avoid colonization, but actually propelled it onto the world stage as an imperial power itself. The outcomes couldn't be more different. Diametrically opposed, really. Okay, so to really get a handle on the dynamics here, let's maybe unpack a foundational concept first. Something that really illuminates the power structures of global imperialism. Dependency theory. Ah, yes, dependency theory. It sounds academic maybe, but it's actually a really powerful lens for viewing how the world was structured back then. How does it work? What's the core idea? Well, what's fascinating is how it maps out this inherently hierarchical relationship that sort of crystallized during this period. It basically divides the world into two distinct and definitely unequal groups. Yeah, you have the Industrialized metropolis countries. These are your imperial powers. And then you have the periphery countries, those that ended up colonized or, you know, heavily exploited. Right. So it lays bare the inequalities built into the system at the time. Exactly. So let's talk about the metropolis side first. Your imperial powers. Great Britain being the classic example. What really defined them? What gave them that immense power? Well, first and foremost, they were modernized and industrialized. But critically, they had highly diversified economies. That's key. Diversified meaning not just one main thing. Precisely. Think about Great Britain in the 19th century. Yes, they produced enormous amounts of cotton textiles. That was huge for them. But they were also manufacturing railroad cars, building steamships, making machinery, armaments, chemicals, complex tools, just a whole range of finished goods. Okay, I see. And this economic diversification, that was their superpower, really. It gave them resilience. If, say, the market for cotton textiles suddenly took a nosedive because of a recession or something. Yeah, or just a shift in fashion. Whatever. Britain's economy wouldn't collapse. They could pivot, rely on their other industries. Selling steamships, exporting machinery. It meant continuous growth, adaptability, stability, a self reinforcing cycle. Got it. So that's the metropolis. Now the other side is the periphery. These are the colonized countries. Their economic structure was fundamentally different. You said, and much more vulnerable. Indeed, very vulnerable. The periphery countries were characterized by what dependency theory calls the monostaple economies. A monostaple one staple. Exactly. It means they primarily produced and exported only one or maybe a very limited number of raw products or resources. Like what? Give us some examples. Think of India, largely forced to specialize in providing raw cotton to British mills. Or Brazil, supplying huge amounts of sugar and coffee to Europe. Okay. West Africa became a source of palm oil. Southeast Asia for rubber. You see the pattern? Yeah. Single commodities, basically. And the vulnerability comes from. The inherent vulnerability is immense. If the global market for that single staple product collapses, maybe oversupply. Maybe a new substitute emerges. Maybe a world war makes people stop buying coffee. The whole economy just tanks. The entire periphery economy would simply crumble. Their national income, jobs, social stability, everything hinged on the external demand for that one product. Wow. That's why it's called dependency. Their economic survival was acutely reliant on the metropolis. They had little or no internal diversification to cushion against shocks. They were locked into being just raw material suppliers, unable to develop their own industries. Right. They couldn't build their own factories, their own industrial capacity, because the system was designed against that. So, connecting the dots, how did this metropolis periphery relationship actually function? In terms of like the, the flow of stuff, the economic exchange, how did the imperial powers profit? It was a very clear, often pretty brutal one way street, almost entirely benefiting the metropolis. Okay. The periphery extracts and provides the raw resources. Cotton, minerals, rubber, food, whatever sends it to the industrialized metropolis. The metropolis with its factories and technology, transforms these raw resources into finished goods. Adds immense value in the process. And then, and here's the kicker, the metropolis then sells these finished, higher value goods back to the periphery. Back to the same people who provided the raw materials. Exactly. The periphery effectively becomes a captive market, A ready made place to sell the manufactured stuff. So using the India example, India sends raw cotton to Britain, Britain makes textiles, Britain sells the textiles back to India. Precisely. It's a closed loop where the imperial power controls both the supply of raw materials and the market for the finished products, maximizing profit at both ends. I remember hearing that India actually used this as a point of protest later on, didn't they? Refusing to buy British goods. Absolutely. That was one of the most powerful, though incredibly difficult methods of protest against British colonialism in India. Think of Gandhi and the spinning wheel, right? Symbolizing self sufficiency. Rejecting imported British cloth a symbol of economic resistance. Exactly this non cooperation, the refusal to buy British finished goods, especially textiles, directly undermined the economic profit, which was, let's face it, the whole point of having an empire. For many involved, it hit them where it hurt their bottom line. It forced them to confront the real cost of maintaining control when the profits started drying up. That makes a lot of sense. Now you mentioned resources were always crucial. But markets, were they always equally important for all colonized territories, or did that vary? That's a really important distinction to make. Resources were, almost without exception, always crucial. Access to cheap, abundant raw materials. There was the lifeblood of their industrial engines. Without the cotton, the coal, the rubber, the minerals, the factories would grind to a halt. Okay, so resources, always vital. Always vital. Markets, however, were not always the primary driver or even a significant factor for all colonized territories. How so? Well, consider for example, island nations like Hawaii or Cuba. They provided incredibly valuable resources, primarily sugar, to the United States. Huge value in the resource itself. Right. But their populations were relatively small. Their internal economies were tiny compared to the US Metropolis. So while their sugar was paramount, their value as markets for American finished goods was, economically speaking, pretty insignificant. So the motivation could be more about the resource than the potential market. And so exactly the demand for new markets could vary in importance depending on the specific territory, its size and the nature of its resources. That's a really critical nuance. So how did the imperial powers actually get control of these resources and territories in the 19th century? Was it friendly negotiation, trade deals? Not usually. Far from it, actually. In the 19th century, the primary mechanism of imperial control was, was almost universally through sheer military power. Right. Force. We're talking direct, forceful subjugation, invasion. Think about Britain gaining control of India's vast resources and population. It wasn't through negotiation. No. They sent a formidable army, suppressed local resistance, often brutally, like during the Sepoy mutiny, and established direct political and military rule. So direct rule enforced by military might. Yes. This isn't quite what we might call economic imperialism today, where influences may be wielded through finance or trade agreement, though that existed too. But the 19th century was heavily characterized by outright military domination and administrative control. Okay, so that's the context. Military power, economic exploitation through this metropolis periphery system. Exactly. And if we bring this back to you, the listener, understanding this framework, dependency theory, military dominance, really helps us grasp the fundamental power dynamics and the economic imperatives that were driving things when European powers armed with overwhelming industrial might, turn their attention eastward towards China and Japan. Absolutely essential context. Okay, so with that framework in mind, let's turn to China, a colossal empire at the start of the 19th century. Arguably the wealthiest, most stable, most populous nation on earth. But their response to this incoming Western challenge, armed with its industrial and military power, was, well, let's just say they weren't exactly rolling out the welcome mat. No, definitely not. You had the Qing Dynasty, also called the Manchu Dynasty, ruling China, then taking power back in the mid 17th century. And they weren't originally Han Chinese. Right. They were from Manchuria. That's right. The Manchus were originally foreigners from Manchuria, northeast of China proper. And to legitimize their rule over this massive Han Chinese population, they very shrewdly underwent this process of sinicization, meaning they adopted Chinese culture, thoroughly adopted the language, political institutions, Confucian philosophy, court rituals, everything. It's a classic strategy, really. We see it elsewhere in history. Barbarian invaders adopting Roman culture, the Mexica adopting Nahuatl culture, Mesoamerica. It was key to cementing their power and gaining acceptance. And by the time the Europeans started knocking more insistently in the 18th and 19th centuries, the king Empire was, as you said, incredibly stable, wealthy, prosperous, almost too prosperous in a way. That immense success, combined with this deep seated cultural confidence, this belief in being the Middle Kingdom, the center of civilization, led to a kind of complacency or resistance to change. Exactly. It bred a profound inability to even imagine needing or desiring fundamental reform. From their perspective, their civilization was the pinnacle. The outside world was viewed largely as a contaminant, something that could only disrupt their harmonious self sufficient, perfect system. A dangerous mindset when the world outside is changing rapidly, tragically unsuited for what was coming. There was bureaucratic inertia, a deeply conservative philosophical outlook, a history of self sufficiency that just actively dismissed foreign ideas. So when European traders started showing up in force centuries earlier, even China didn't exactly embrace free trade. They had a very restrictive system, didn't they? Far from it. China always viewed foreign trade as a privilege granted by the emperor, not a right. And it was tightly controlled. By the 18th century, this hardened into the Canton system. Tell us about that, how did it work? Basically, foreign traders were strictly confined to specific port cities, mainly Canton, which is now Guangzhou and later Macau. These were walled off areas, almost like ghettos for foreigners. Really in trouble? Very. Trade was only allowed through a limited number of licensed Chinese merchants, the Kouhongs. Foreigners couldn't bring families, couldn't travel inland, weren't supposed to learn Chinese, couldn't even deal directly with officials. Trade was seasonal. They had to leave afterwards. Wow. So the goal was maximum control, minimum influence. Precisely. Keep the foreigners contained, keep their potentially disruptive ideas out and keep China firmly in control of its own economy and trade. Preserve that isolation. But as we discussed with the metropolis, economies in industrial capitalism needs to expand. Yeah, it constantly needs new markets for manufactured goods, new sources of raw materials. That sounds like a direct clash with China's closed system. It was an absolute powder keg waiting to explode. The British, the French, the Portuguese, they kept trying to pry open the huge potential of the Chinese market. Diplomatic missions, petitions. And China wasn't interested. Largely unsuccessful. China just saw no compelling reason to engage more deeply. They felt they produced everything they needed. And European goods were mostly seen as inferior trinkets, not essentials. This left the British with a problem, right? A trade imbalance, a massive trade deficit. The British were buying enormous quantities of Chinese tea, silk, porcelain. But the Chinese weren't buying much British stuff in return. This imbalance grew and grew, becoming a major frustration in London. So the British needed to find something, anything. The Chinese would actually want to buy something to balance the books and crack open that market. And tragically, cynically, they found it. Opium. Ah, here we go. Yes. This is where the story takes an incredibly dark turn. The British East India Company had a monopoly on opium production in India. They, and later other independent British and American Traders started illegally smuggling massive quantities of opium into China. Illegally, but with official backing. It was essentially a state sanctioned drug trademark. To really grasp the scale and cynicism, imagine powerful South American drug cartels flooding the US with narcotics today. Okay, now imagine the trade was explicitly sanctioned, protected and profited from by, say, the Colombian government and a parliament. That's the chilling parallel. It was a deliberate strategy by the British state and associated companies to reverse the trade deficit by addicting the Chinese population. That is a disturbing analogy. And the impact in China must have been devastating. Catastrophic. Opium addiction tore through Chinese society from the highest officials to the poorest peasants. It caused widespread social chaos, ruined families economically and led to a massive drain of silver out of China to pay for the drug, reversing the trade balance violently. So the Chinese government eventually had to act. They saw the devastation. They decided they had to stop it. They issued stern orders. Foreigners must cease opium imports. The foreign merchants largely ignored them. So China escalated. Yes. The imperial Commissioner, Lin Zexu, a figure of real integrity, took decisive action in Canton. He confiscated and publicly destroyed over 20,000 chests of opium. That's something like 1200 tons of the stuff, worth millions. Even then, a huge statement. And the British reaction? Outrage, but not moral outrage about the drug trade. Outrage about the destruction of what they call private property, their valuable commodity. Unbelievable. They demanded massive reparations for the destroyed opium. When China refused, Britain declared war in 1839, the First Opium War. In the military balance, I imagine it wasn't close, not even remotely. It was a clash of centuries. China's military was essentially medieval. Outdated weapons, tactics, training. They were facing modern Britain, post industrial revolution. Steamships, Cannons. Exactly. Steamships that could ignore currents and wind. Powerful naval cannons that outranged anything. The Chinese had advanced rifles. The British forces just sliced through the Chinese defenses. The outcome was never really in doubt. So China was easily defeated. Forced to pay reparations, forced to open up. This is where we get that phrase, China carved up like a melon. Indeed, the defeat led to the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842, the first of the unequal treaties. What did it involve? China had to cede Hong Kong island to Britain. They had to open five more treaty ports to British trade and residents, allowing much deeper penetration. And they had to pay a huge indemnity, basically paying Britain back for the opium they destroyed. And the cost of the war. And other powers jumped in. Oh, yes. This opened the floodgates. Other Western powers, France, the us, Russia quickly demanded and got similar treaties, often even more advantageous. And China progressively Lost control over its own economy, its territory, its resources. Which led to these spheres of influence? Exactly. The carved up like a melon image captures it perfectly. China was divided up. Different imperial powers. Britain, France, Russia, later Japan, Germany, the US Each claimed exclusive rights in specific regions, like exclusive trading rights, trading rights, investment privileges, rights to build railways, open mines, even station troops. You could look at a map from the time and see regions colored. Colored pink for British influence, blue for French, yellow for Russian, and so on. All asserting dominance within China. And the loss of sovereignty went even deeper, didn't it? Something about legal control. Absolutely. A key example is extraterritoriality. What's that? It meant that foreigners in China, a British merchant, an American missionary, whoever, if they committed a crime in China, they wouldn't be tried in Chinese courts under Chinese law. Where would they be tried? In their own national courts, often consular courts set up right there in China under their own laws. So China was stripped of judicial control over foreigners on its own soil. A massive humiliation. Immense. It signaled that China's legal system was considered inferior, incapable of delivering justice to Westerners. The cumulative impact of these defeats, the unequal treaties, the spheres of influence, extraterritoriality. It was a profound, deeply felt national humiliation for China by Western powers and significantly, also by Japan, which would soon join the imperial game. And this whole process, this carving up, this subjugation, it was often justified by that ideology we mentioned earlier, Social Darwinism. Yes. It provided a chillingly convenient, though deeply flawed rationale that was widely accepted in imperial circles at the time. Remind us how that worked again. Well, Social Darwinism took Darwin's biological concept of survival of the fittest, where species adapt or die out due to environmental changes like an ice age or whatever, and cynically applied it to human nations and societies. And in this twisted logic, the change in environment wasn't natural. It was the industrial revolution. Modernization. So the argument was nations had to adapt to this new industrial environment. Precisely. And the imperialists, many Americans, British Europeans, looked at China's inability or unwillingness to rapidly modernize and industrialize and basically said, see? They failed the test. Exactly. They failed the test of fitness. They couldn't adapt to the modern world. Therefore, its subjugation, its carving up, was seen not just as acceptable, but almost as a natural outcome, a validation of China's supposed unfitness or backwardness. It justified the exploitation. It rationalized immense acts of power and dominance, painting them not as aggression, but as the inevitable working out of natural law. It implied these inferior nations were destined to be ruled by superior Ones. It's crucial to understand that mindset, to understand the era. Okay, a truly grim picture for China. Let's shift gears now and turn our attention to Japan. The story starts similarly deep isolation, resistance to outsiders. But their path took a dramatically different turn, a transformative one that would completely redefine their place in the world. Absolutely. Before the mid-19th century, Japan was under the very rigid rule of the Tokugawa Shogunate. This was a military government that had run the country for over 250 years, since about 1603. And the Emperor? The Emperor was still there in Kyoto, revered as a divine figurehead. But the real political and military power rested with the Shogun based in Edo, which is modern day Tokyo. And like China, extremely closed off. Extremely. Tokugawa Japan had perfected isolation. Foreigners were almost completely banned. Japanese citizens were forbidden from leaving any foreign ship that came near without permission, faced hostility. Sometimes cannon fire, kill on sight was sometimes the policy for unwanted arrivals. Wow. So just as isolated as King China. Maybe even more so. But I've heard it said there were already some maybe subtle internal cracks in Japan's perfect society even before the west arrived. Tensions that maybe made it more ripe for change than China. That's a very sharp point and yeah, it's quite accurate. On the surface, Tokugawa Japan looked incredibly stable, this rigid hierarchy. But underneath, significant imbalances had been developing for decades. Like what the samurai, the warrior class, think feudal lords were technically at the top, but their income, often paid in rice, stipends was fixed. Meanwhile, the economy was increasingly based on money. And the merchant class, not only at the bottom, was becoming quite wealthy and influential. So the warriors were getting poorer and the merchants richer? In many cases, yes. Many samurai fell into serious debt to the merchants. This created this weird underlying tension, a sort of quiet challenge to the official power structure. Interesting. So this subtle economic shift, this discontent among some samurai and the rising power of merchants, meant Japan wasn't quite as monolithic or resistant to internal pressure as it might have seemed when that external shock finally hit. These groups became key players later on. And that external shock famously arrived with Commodore Matthew Perry and his American black ships forcibly opening Japan. What was the immediate impact? Yeah, the catalyst was definitely Commodore Perry. In 1853. He sails his squadron of steam powered warships, the Japanese call them Kurafun blackships because of the coal smoke and their color. Right into Edo Bay near modern Tokyo. Must have been terrifying, profoundly unsettling. These weren't sailing ships. They were large, smoke belching, engine powered vessels bristling with cannons. Perry delivered a letter from the US President demanding Japan open its ports for trade and for American ships to refuel. Then he left, promising to come back with more ships. And did he? He did. In 1854, with an even larger fleet. The Japanese leadership, the Shogunate officials, faced with this overwhelming technological and military superiority, they could see the cannons. They understood the implications, felt they had no realistic choice but to concede. Despite wanting isolation, despite their deep desire for isolation, they were forced to recognize the undeniable power of the last. They signed the Convention of Kanagawa, opening a couple of ports to American ships. And that opening wasn't just for the Americans. Right. Once the door was pushed open. Exactly. Once Perry cracked the door open. Other imperial powers, Britain, France, Russia, the Netherlands quickly followed. They demanded and got similar treaties, often called unequal treaties, just like in China. Granting them special privileges. Yes, things like extraterritoriality, fixed low tariffs on imports that benefited them. Most favored nation clauses, meaning any privilege granted to one country automatically applied to others. So Japan was suddenly facing the same pressures as China. Precisely. And Japanese nationalists, especially younger educated samurai and intellectuals, were watching very closely what had just happened in China. The Opium wars, the unequal treaties, the spheres of influence. They saw the writing on the wall. Modernize or be colonized. It was that stark. The immediate realization struck a truly radical revolutionary response in Japan, and that became known as the Meiji Restoration. Not just a change of government, but a deliberate, conscious, and as you said, incredibly painful national project to completely remake Japanese society. That's exactly what it was. The realization of the threat led to rapid political upheaval. A powerful coalition, mainly of samurai from western domains who felt marginalized by the Tokugawa, along with some court nobles, rebelled. They successfully overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868 and put the Emperor back in charge. Nominally, nominally, yes. They restored the young Emperor Meiji to direct imperial rule, at least symbolically. That's why it's called the Meiji Restoration. But the real power was wielded by a group, an oligarchy, of these determined, visionary young ex samurai and court figures. And they had a plan. They did. They were highly educated. Many had studied western systems, Western military power. They effectively seized control of the government and with an almost ruthless determination, forced the entire nation onto a path of rapid top down modernization. A revolution from above, driven by survival, forced industrialization. And as you highlighted earlier, that transition from agrarian to industrial is often brutal for the population. Britain took 150 years, kind of organically. Japan did it consciously, much faster. And that's the crucial difference. And where the Pain came in. Britain's industrial revolution was unplanned, messy, spread over a century and a half. Japan didn't have that luxury. They had the advantage of seeing what worked elsewhere and the urgent need to catch up now. So they studied the west meticulously. They sent missions abroad, the famous Iwakura Mission, to study everything, industry, government, military, education, legal systems in the us, Britain, Germany, France. They literally imported Western technology, hired foreign experts, copied Western institutions. A conscious plan, a conscious, centrally planned program for rapid industrialization and modernization. And yes, this transition was incredibly painful for a lot of people. How so? What kind of pain? Huge social upheaval. The samurai class, the warrior elite for centuries, was formally abolished. Their stipends were cut, their right to wear swords revoked. Many faced economic ruin, loss of status. There were samurai rebellions like the Satsuma Rebellion, which the new conscript army had to suppress. And for ordinary people, Peasants were often uprooted from traditional farming communities to work long, hard hours in new factories, textile mills, coal mines, often under difficult conditions for low pay. The government imposed new taxes to pay for modernization. It was a period of intense social disruption and hardship for many, but it worked in terms of the goal. This harsh, almost brutal transformation, compressed into maybe 40 years, yielded undeniable results. Japan became strong enough militarily and economically to withstand the efforts to colonize it by the Western powers. They renegotiated the unequal treaties. From a position of strength, they built a modern army and navy. And they didn't just withstand colonization. They became colonizers themselves, demonstrating their power in the Russo Japanese war. That war, 1904, 1905, was a watershed moment. Japan took on and for all intents and purposes, defeated a major European power, the Russian Empire. They defeated Russian armies on land in Manchuria and annihilated the Russian Baltic Fleet at the Battle of Tsushima. A huge shock to the world. A massive shock, not just to Russia, but globally. It fundamentally challenged those prevailing racist, social Darwinist assumptions that Asian peoples were inherently inferior or incapable of matching Western military might. It proved an Asian nation could be a first rate power. Exactly. Japan demonstrated that an Asian power can actually be a first rate world power. Yeah. It shattered myths and had huge psychological repercussions across Asia and the colonized world. And then, like Britain before it, an industrialized island nation needing resources, Japan decided it needed its own empire. Precisely. Having industrialized, having built this powerful military, but lacking sufficient natural resources like iron ore, coal, oil on their home islands, they followed the imperial playbook. They'd learned from the west, if you need resources and markets, you go out and take them by force if necessary. Japan embarked on its own path of imperialism and it was often brutal, starting with Korea. Yes, they exerted increasing influence, then formally annexed Korea in 1910. Their colonial rule there was harsh, exploitative, focused on extracting resources and suppressing Korean culture. Immense suffering for the Korean people. And then they turned towards China again. In the 1930s, driven by militarism, ultranationalism and the continuing need for resources, Japan launched a full scale invasion of Manchuria, setting up a puppet state, and then invaded China proper in 1937. This compounded China's earlier humiliations, this time at the hands of an Asian neighbor that had modernized while China hadn't. And this Japanese empire building in Asia and the Pacific, it set the stage for later conflicts directly. This aggressive expansion created intense competition with the United States in terms of industrial control of the Pacific. Both powers were vying for resources, markets, naval dominance in the region. This rivalry, born directly from Japan's modernization and its imperial ambitions, became a primary fundamental cause of World War II in the Pacific. So Japan adapted, avoided colonization, but the path it took led straight into imperialism and global conflict. Yes, it's a complex legacy. They met the challenge, but the way they met it, by adopting the imperial model, wholesale reshaped the global landscape and led to devastating consequences. What an incredible stark contrast. China resisting modernization, clinging to tradition, ends up humiliated, subjugated, carved up. Its refusal to engage with that changing global environment had devastating long term consequences. While Japan, embracing a painful, forced top down modernization, avoids colonization, transforms its entire society deliberately, and emerges as a formidable imperial power itself ready to compete on the world stage. It really does encapsulate that central dilemma of the 19th century for many nations modernize or be colonized. China resisted. Japan adapted at immense human cost, but secured its independence and built its own empire. Two utterly different responses to the same fundamental pressure. So as you, our listener, think about these two very different historical paths, maybe consider the lasting implications. How do these stories of resilience, humiliation, adaptation, the pursuit of power, how do they continue to echo? How do they shape how we understand national identity, international relations, economic development, particularly in East Asia, but maybe globally too, even today. Yeah, it raises a really important question for us to mull over, doesn't it? How might the echoes of those 19th century decisions, those fundamental choices made by China and Japan, under immense pressure, how might they still be influencing geopolitics, cultural viewpoints, economic strategies right now, long after the formal age of imperialism ended? It's a question that definitely still resonates in our world today, shaping alliances, rivalries, and how nations see themselves in each other.

Sa. Sam. Sa. Sa. Sam. Sa. Are you guys awake now? See, can you hear me? Yes. Yes. Hold on a second. Oh, crap. We can hear you. Can you hear us? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, we can hear you. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Yes. Yes. Yes or no? Yes. Let me say something so I can see if you hear me. You can't hear us? No, I can't hear you. Oh, I know why. All right, somebody fixed something. Can you hear me now? Something? Yes. Okay, there you go. All right, we're good now. So did you guys like my song? Did you hear it? John Williams? Yes. Yeah. You know why I played that song today? The Empire. The Imperial March. Empire. Exactly. You know. All right, so now let me just ask you this question. When I say empire and imperial, what country do you guys think of? United States. Great Britain. Really? Japan? China. Okay. Japan. Okay. Well, those are. All right. The only thing that I. I think that the kind of the model for the age of imperialism was Britain. Great Britain. So we'll be looking a lot at what happened with the British, also the French. And then we have one day we're going to talk just about American imperialism. Well, maybe something else too, but. All right, so that's what we're going to do today. I'm not sure that our session today is going to be very long because what I've done, I've got two videos. One of them you guys have hopefully already seen. That's the two coasts of China. And it basically covers everything that I would cover in a lecture about imperialism. And then there's the next episode in that series is about Japan. And I'm going to. Actually, we're going to show. We're going to do a discussion on that next week. So starting Thursday, we'll be done with the discussion on China and we'll start with the discussion on Japan. And again, the video will go over all the parts that are. Are important for our discussion here in the class. What I'm going to do today is just go through the high points, basically. So you're going to really need to watch the videos in order to be able to. To get what happened in China and Japan. The main thing that I'm trying for us to understand with the Asian countries with China and Japan is the contrast over the challenge of the 19th century or the challenge of modernization. Does anybody remember what the challenge of modernization was? Was it the modernize or die? Modernize or be colonized. Right. So what. Has anybody actually watched the China video yet? I'M about halfway through. Yeah. Okay. But has. Nobody's actually finished it. Well, I'm going to give you a spoil. Eric did. Okay, so what happens at the end, Eric? I was actually on the same boat as Aaron. I. I'm like a little bit over halfway. Okay, we need to know. Well, I'm going to give you a spoiler then. And what happens is that China is not able. In fact, China refuses to modernize because China feels that it has achieved the pinnacle of civilization. And the result of it is that they become colonized by the Western powers and Japan. Okay, so the alternative, the kind of contrast to that is what happens in Japan because Japan recognizes what happened in China and other places and realizes that they need to modernize or they will be colonized. And so they do that. But the, the consequence of that is going to be that Japan becomes another imperial power like Britain or France or Germany or the United States. So that's this. What we're looking at in these two videos is the challenge of modernization. Modernize or be colonized. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, now, I haven't got. I haven't made that other movie available to you yet. I will do that by Thursday, though. Okay. Any other. Any questions about anything that I can help you with, Professor, Are you. Were you able to put up the recorded lectures for the midterm so we can study over there? I have not gotten to it yet. But, you know, I actually, that's a good. I'm glad you brought that up because I actually misspoke about the midterm. It's not Thursday. It's next Tuesday. Thursday we'll be lecturing on Africa. So. So the, the midterm is not until next week. On Tuesday, a week from today. Okay, I figured out. I'm sorry. So Tuesday is when it starts and that's when we'll get our groups. Right. And then we'll have till. Yeah, Thursday or next. This. Well, today is Tuesday, so it's not today. So it's next. No, I mean, I mean next. I mean next Tuesday because I. Yeah. Okay, well, let me. Let me just try to show you something here. I actually, I don't. I'm. I'm not. I put all you guys in groups already, right? You can find out your groups by going to people, and then you should be able to see the group that you're in by pressing group. Okay. So. So hopefully I. I'm pretty sure this is actually public, but I've already assigned everybody to groups and there's no. What do they call it? No appeal. You're in the group that I put you in and that's the way it is. Right? Because I did it for a reason. Okay. So anyway, so your, your groups are already set. I'll give you some time on Tuesday to work on getting together and how to communicate with each other and things like that. Okay. Any other questions about anything? Let me quickly run into, let me just jump into this, this lecture. You know what's interesting is I tried to do something a little bit different. The first thing I really want to talk about is dependency. What is this? I hate this. Okay. Dependency, because dependency is a theory of imperialism essentially that demonstrates the relationship between the imperial powers and the colonized countries. And what I did was I actually made a little video. So I want you guys to watch my little four minute video. It's actually less than four minutes. And then, and then we'll, we'll talk about it. Okay. One way to explain the relationship between industrialized countries and colonized countries is dependency theory. Dependency theory divides the world into two different groups of countries, the metropolis and the periphery. The metropolis is the country that is. Oh, professor, it's super quiet. Barely hear it. I, I know. I don't know how to turn it up. Can you turn it up there more than one thing? So, for example, if we were talking about Great Britain, we could say that. Still can't hear it. Cotton textiles. But they also. Let me try something here. Is, is this video on YouTube? It's not on YouTube. It's, it's, it's. So that if it's. It's in the lecture? Yeah, it's in the, the online lecture. So let me go back, try it again, see if you can hear it. Now, one way to explain. Can you check your volume bar? The one that just popped up when you're hovering, Is it all the way up? Because our mine's all the way up and I can't really hear it. Yeah, yours is too. Yeah, mine's up too. You can't hear it. It's very, very modern. All right, well, let me do this then. Let me do. Let's see. I'm going to start with. Dependency theory is a way of describing the relationship between industrialized countries, modernized countries, and colonized countries. And what dependency theory does is divides the world into two different groups of countries, those that are modernized and those that are colonized. And we call those two different groups of countries the metropolis as the imperial powers and the periphery as the colonized countries. Okay, so the colonized Countries, excuse me, the metropolis, are the modernized industrialized and diversified economies. Right. So what that means is that the modernized country is an industrialized economy, but it's producing more than one. Good. Right. So if we were talking about Britain, we would say that Britain produces cotton textiles, but it also produces railroad cars and steamships and things like that. So that if there was a downturn in the cotton textile market, they would still be able to make money by selling railroads and steamships. And so the economy would not collapse. It might. It might hurt, but it won't. It wouldn't collapse. On the other hand, India. Let's keep going. The colonized countries example, if we were talking about Great Britain, we could say that they make cotton textiles, but they. All right, okay, so here we go. So India provides cotton to the British textile industry, but it only provides that one thing. Monostaple means one thing, which means that if the textile industry in Britain experiences a downturn, the entire economy of India will collapse. This is true of all the colonized countries. For example, in India, they actually do produce other things besides cotton. They produce cotton and indigo and those sorts of things. Also opium. Yeah, but then if you look at, for example, Brazil, Brazil produces sugar and coffee. So if there's. There's never going to be a downturn in the, in the market for, for sugar. But, you know, during World wars, they don't need. They don't need. People don't buy coffee because they can't afford it. And so the British, the Brazilian economy collapses. Do you guys understand what I'm saying? That's what the caveat of selling only one thing or having your economy based on the export of only one thing is that if the market for that one thing falls out, then your whole economy will collapse. All right, you guys got that? And that's why they call it dependency theory. All right, now the, the. They call it. Oh, let's see. So the relationship then between the metropolis and the periphery is that the periphery provides resources. For example, India provides cotton. And also India is a market. India provides a market. Right. For the finished goods. So what happens is that the people in India send cotton to Britain, Britain turns it into cotton textiles and sells those textiles in India. One of the things that we'll find out a little bit later when we talk about India is that one of the ways that India protested against the British colonialism was by refusing to buy the finished goods. Because if they're not buying the finished goods, there's no point in having an empire. The whole point of it is to make is to make money. Right? Now the one thing that I want to say about that is that resources are always important in the relationship between Britain and, between the periphery and the metropolis, but markets aren't, okay? So sometimes a country will provide something that's very valuable to the metropolis, but they don't have a big enough market to really have a significant impact on the metropolis. And one example of that is Hawaii. So Hawaii or Cuba. Cuba and Hawaii provided sugar to the United States. But their, their, their markets were so small, their economies were so small that the markets were insignificant. Okay, so markets aren't always the issue when it comes to, to imperialism, but resources are. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this? You guys are all still with me? Yeah, it's like Africa. Last thing I want to talk about is how, like, you're not selling the diamonds back to the African community. Economy isn't big enough to exactly provide a meaningful. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, dang. Damn it. Provide a meaningful. Okay, yeah, so, so now the, the last thing I want to talk about is how does the imperial power gain control of the resources of the colonized country? And it, it's always based on military power. Okay, I'm not talking about today. I'm talking about in, in the past, in the 19th century, when, which is what we talk about as the age of imperialism. Up until I'd say World War I, okay, that Britain was able to take control of India's economy because Britain sent an army to India and put down the local rebellion or resistance to British colonialism. So Britain directly ruled India, okay, Using its military force. There is another way of maintaining control or gaining control, which is called economic imperialism. And we'll talk about that on a different day. All right, so that's dependency theory. Any questions? Comments? You guys are all good. You're all with me. Okay, then I'm done with that. Let's talk about China. And again, this is all in the movie, so I'm not going to go over in, in great detail, but the. We start really with the Manchu dynasty. If you look at the movie, it starts with the Mongols, as I already talked about the Mongol Empire and the Ming Empire and then how that transformed into the Qing or the Manchu Empire. The Manchu Dynasty in China. The Manchus were actually foreigners. They were from, from Manchuria. But they gained control of China and they became sinicized, which means that they adopted the Chinese culture. One place where you can maybe understand where we've seen this before, actually a couple places. One is when the barbarians invaded Europe and essentially took down the Roman Empire. When they did that, they also adopted the Roman culture. And then also you may remember me talking about how when the Mexica invaded Central Mexico and took over central Mexico, they also adopted the Nahuatl culture. So that they used that, they do that as a way of cementing their legitimacy and power. So that's what the Qing did. The Qing actually ruled China as a Chinese empire. But one of the things about the Qing Empire was that it became so stable and so wealthy, so prosperous, that it couldn't imagine reform. It couldn't. Not only could it not imagine reform, it didn't really want to have anything to do with the outside world. They saw the outside world as. As kind of a contaminant in a way. And so they. When Europeans finally showed up in the 16th and 17th century, they were very tightly controlled in port cities, like. Like Canton. Right? You guys will again see this in the video. The port cities basically confined, or Macau was another one. The port cities confined the foreign traders to a section that was walled off. And they were not allowed to go into the Chinese Empire or into China. And then the Chinese, only a certain number of Chinese were able to trade with them. And that kept the. The Chinese totally in control of their economy and their trade. Okay, but the nature of industrial capitalism is that you need to be able to expand your markets. And so the British and later the French and the Portuguese, all these other groups tried to open up the Chinese markets with little success. They finally found a product that China wanted. Keep in mind that China had everything it needed. But they found a product that the Chinese, not China, but the Chinese wanted, which was opium. And they started to import opium actually illegally into China. So in a way, you can think about the British Empire as South American drug lords smuggling drugs into the United States to make money. Only thing was that this was sanctioned by the British Crown, by the parliament. Right. But at any rate, the point is that the British started to make lots of money. And actually then the Americans and other countries got involved in it as well. But it was having a very detrimental effect on Chinese culture. And so the result was that the Chinese government decided to stop the import of opium. And they told the foreigners to stop importing the opium, and the importers refused to do it. And so the Chinese then took all their opium and burned it. And the response to that was outrage on the part of the British because the British said, they've taken our private property and they've destroyed it. We need to make Them pay reparations. And so the British then declared war on China. And there was. The military balance between China and Britain was nowhere near equal. The military power of the Chinese was essentially medieval. And now we're talking about modern Britain with steamships and cannons and all the different kinds of things that they've developed through the Industrial revolution. And so China was very easily put down. Its military was. Was put down. And the Chinese were forced not only to pay reparations, but to also open up China. So that's where we see China becoming carved up like a melon. Right. And here's a representation of how that happened. Here's China, the prostrate giant. And then you have. I think this is Germany and Russia, and I'm not sure who that is. And then there's the United States over here. Right. But anyway, all these different Japan here. Right. All these different countries are. Are. Are dividing up China into spheres of influence. Right. And so here you can see the British sphere of influence was pink, and then this blue part was the French and the Japanese and the Germans and the Americans were there as well. So the point here is really that China lost control of its resources because China was forced not only to pay reparations, but to grant concessions to the foreign powers, where foreign powers could not be tried in. Or I should say foreign residents could not be tried in Chinese courts. So if Britain was an Englishman, was in China and broke the law, then he would be tried in a British court, but not in a Chinese court. And so essentially what that means is that China has lost its sovereignty. And, and the. Basically it is. What's the word I'm looking for? It's humiliated. China is humiliated by the Western powers and, and also by Japan. Okay, questions? Comments about any of this? Now, one thing, we talked about this earlier. I talked about social Darwinism. Do you guys remember me talking about Social Darwinism? Yes. Yes. What is Social Darwinism? What is Social Darwinism? Survival of the fittest. Right. But how. How does it play out? What's the. What's the. What happens that makes some people survive and other people not survive? The. What is the. Remember when Darwin, Darwin's theory. Darwin's theory was that with a change in environment, some species will adapt and survive and others will die out. The change of environment was the weather. So it could be an ice age or a heat wave or something like that. Right. But in Social Darwinism, what is the change of environment? Modernization, Industrialization. Exactly. Scientific revolution, any of those. Industrialization, Exactly. Right. So it's industrialization. Mainly right, so moving from an agrarian medieval economy to a modernized economy because of that modernization, some countries, we talked about people, but it also works with countries. Right? So I mean, this is the way they look at it, right? So the country, like China, China was not able to adapt to the new environment. And so it was carved up like a melon. All right, this is the way some people, many Americans and British imperialists will look at this. Is that they. It was, it was acceptable to carve up China because China wasn't able to adapt to the new age. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, Comments about that. So that's how we apply social Darwinism then to imperialism. All right. Questions, comments? All right, so let's take a look then at Japan. Japan came into contact with, with Westerners at a later date. Okay, so the, the what you guys remember me talking about earlier and what you will see in the video when I make it available to you is that the, the emperor, the empire was essentially Japanese empire. Emperor was essentially a figurehead and the country was ruled by shoguns. The, the original, the first one was Tokugawa, so they call it the Tokugawa Shogunate. In this Tokugawa shogunate, like China, they developed a very stable society. The difference between China and Japan was that as time went by in Japan, the people who were supposedly in control, the samurai, who we would think of as like lords in Europe, fell into debt with the merchants. And so there was a kind of a check on the power of the people who were supposed to be in charge. And so by the time Japan has to deal with Western powers, there's already some imbalance in this so called perfect society in Japan. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments? Okay, so now Commodore Perry was an American, American commodore. And he sailed into. I'm not sure if it was Edo. I think it may have been Edo. Edo is Tokyo. Right. But at any rate, he sailed into Japan. Japan was very closed off. If you were a foreigner and you went into Japan without permission, they would kill you. Japan was very closed off. They did not want to have any contact with the outside world. But when Commodore Perry shows up in Japan with his black ship, and this is a Japanese representation of what the Western ships looked like, right. The Japanese were forced to recognize that Western power was superior to their own power, and they opened up. So Commodore Perry is credited with opening Japan to foreign trade. But when Japan opened up to foreign trade with Americans, then the other imperial powers also started to move in. So the Americans went in and then the British went in and The French went in and Germans went in. And what they saw happening in Japan was the same as what had happened in China. This basically colonization of the Japanese economy. And so there was a group of people who were nationalists, Japanese nationalists, and they realized that if they were not, if they did not modernize, they were going to be colonized. And so what they did was there was a rebellion against the shogunate. The shogunate was ended. The Emperor was placed in control. The name of the Emperor was Meiji, but he was really not in control. Who was really in control was a group of educated Westernized Japanese intellectuals essentially, and some military people who took control of the Japanese economy and the Japanese, really the whole Japanese nation, and forced it into modernization. All right, so now when we think about, for example, the industrial revolution in England, in order for it to make the transition from agriculture to industry, it took 150 years. Okay. Keep in mind it wasn't like in 1760, the British Parliament sat down and said, okay, we're going to modernize now. Right. Because they didn't know what that was. It was just what was happening. Right. And so the process of what happened in England was essentially unknown at the beginning, but it wasn't unknown in Japan. People in Japan could study what had happened in England and what happened in the United States and what had happened in France and Germany and recognize what had to happen to make Japan a modernized country. And they implemented that plan. The plan, as you're going to see in the video and as we already know from studying the industrial Revolution, is that the transition from agriculture to industry is incredibly painful for a lot of people. And Japan basically endured that for 40 years. But the outcome was that they became powerful enough to. To withstand the efforts to colonize it by the Western powers. Okay. And where we can see that in first demonstrated was in what they call the Russo Japanese War. The Russo Japanese war happened in 1905. And although the war was actually ended without one side defeating the other, theoretically, because there was a treaty that was negotiated by Theodore Roosevelt, the reality was that the Japanese were able to withstand the might of the Russian armies. This is not the Soviet Union then. It was Russia. Right. And that was a shock not only to Russia, but to the rest of the world as well. Asian countries. By this time, people everywhere in the world believed that Asia was. People in Asia were inferior. They couldn't withstand pressure from the Western powers. And here, Japan has demonstrated that an Asian power can actually be a first rate world power. Okay, so that's where we see the fruit of this forced industrialization is that Japan doesn't become colonized, But Japan is very much like Britain, for example, who has a large industrial plant but doesn't have the resources it needs. And so Britain established an empire around the world to be able to control resources. Japan decides to do the same thing. So in the early part of the 20th century, Japan invades Korea and takes control of Korea and rules Korea in a brutal way. It's a brutal imperialism. It's as bad or worse than European imperialism. And then in the 1930s, Japan invades China. So China. China's kind of humiliation comes also at the expense of Japanese expansion. Right. So the result then is that Japan is trying to establish an empire throughout the western Pacific in order to be able to support its industrial plant. That is what's going to put it in competition with the United States in terms of industrial control of the Pacific. And that will directly then lead to the Japanese American war that we call World War II in the Pacific. Okay, so that's going to be the result then of imperialism and modernization in Japan. All right. Questions? Comments about this? Well, that's the case. Then. Does the video. So the video goes into. Let you guys go. The video goes into Japan because I'm. I'm at 30 minutes, and it's where the. They're talking about India and the opium. China or is it just China? It's just China in one video. The other video that I'm going to show you starting Thursday is Japan. Oh, okay. Okay, got it. So it's. It's part of a series. It's part of a series. The first one is China. The second one's Japan. Okay, got it. But I think that what you'll find is that when you watch the. The first video and you watch the second video, you'll hear basically what I. What I just gave you today in class, but in a better, better format. It'll be more understandable, I think. Okay. Questions? Comments? Except for my. Except for my stupid video about industrialization or dependency theory that makes me unhappy, but I can fix it. All right? So anyway, how's it going? Everybody's ready? Everybody's good. Any questions at all that I can help you with? Okay. Remember again, next Tuesday is going to be the midterm, and I've are. If you want to find out what your group is, you can go look at online and I'll go over it with you next week. All right? Questions? Comments about anything. So after we're in the groups. That's right. And I'll See you on Thursday after we're in the groups. That's like one week of. We're in together for like, a week as a group before we turn it in. Or. No, that's going to be. It's going to be your group for the rest of the. For the rest of the semester. You guys are going to be doing another. Another exam and also a presentation later in the course. Okay, I'll be working on that presentation, really coming up pretty quickly. Okay, so does that answer your question? Yes. All right, then. Live long and prosper. You know, the proper response to that is peace and long life. Take care, guys. Long life. One more question, Professor. Yes? I just wanted to ask really quickly. You did mention that the groups are online and already posted for us, and I was just curious where I could find that information. People, it should be 100 people on canvas. You click the word group. Yeah. Okay, I got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. All right, go. Actually, I already did live a long life compared to you guys. All right, take care, guys. It.

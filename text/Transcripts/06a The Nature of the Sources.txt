Somebody say something to me? Hello? Hello? Are there any questions around? Otherwise I just go back to sleep. Not at the moment. Okay. Still don't know what I was waiting for. My time was running wild. Every time I thought God had made that secret. The taste was not so sweet. So I turned myself to face me. But I've never caught a glimpse how the others will see if they come I'm much too fast to take that test. Turn and face the strange to change hands. You wanna be a richer man. Turn and face the strange changes. It's going to have to be a different man now. May change me, but I can change their size. But never leave the stream of warm permanent sand. So the days float through my. But still the days seem the same. And these children that you spit on as they try to change their worlds are immune to your consultations. Quite aware of what they're going through. You can twist time strange lasting nation. May change me, but I can't trace now. I said that now. May change me, but I can't trace down. You know why I played that song today? Because changing. Well, because we're going through changes. Well, that's. You know, the only thing that is constant is change. The only thing never changes. It's always changing. Well, the reason I played it was because I don't have a really good song for today's session that we're going to be doing. And since history is all about change, figure, well, I might as well play that song anyway. Any questions or comments about anything? I just want to remind you guys, I don't want to go into it, but next week we're going to be discussing. We're going to start talking about the Enlightenment on Thursday, and next week we're going to be discussing Locke's second treatise on civil government. And I've assigned parts of that document to you, not the whole document. And the part that you have to read isn't really that long. But it's not easy. It's not an easy read because it's old language. So you might want to give yourself a little time to trying to figure out what it's all about. All right. Any questions, comments, Anything I can help you with? If you want to come to my office hours, they're right after this class. Yes, Aaron, that document's not up yet, right? The lock document you have to buy. Oh, there is there. I think there's a link in the. In the assignment. Let me look. Okay. Okay. I forgot that was a. An actual got. But I think I may have put A link in it to the Gutenberg version. Can you guys see the canvas page? Yes. Okay. I didn't actually put the link, so here, let me do this. Professor? Yes. Was the document analysts and the nature of resources actually due today at 12:45pm because in my head, I thought it was due at midnight, so I wasn't able to turn it in before class. Huh. Well, I remember I mentioned to you guys that it should have been every. The only thing that's turned in on the day that it's due is the discussions because you're supposed to have done the work before class starts. And as far as I know, the. Let me go back. As far as I know that you can still turn the document in, but in order to be able to turn it in late, you have to get a code, and the only place you can get a code is in my office hours. Okay. That's your question? Yeah. Well, I'm just looking at the assignment right now, but there's, like, nowhere where you can turn it in. I think the only way that I'd be able to turn it in now is to email you, but if there's another way, I'm not sure. No, I'll fix that for you. Okay, gotcha. Okay, well, then I'll see you. Yeah, I have the same situation, but I'm still setting up my router, so I still can't do the assignment. All right, so there's a link to the. To the Gutenberg version of Second Treatise. So if you don't have it, you can. You can actually read it right there. It's not. It's not the most elegant version of it, but, I mean, it's all text, but the words are all there, so. Okay. Questions? Comments? All right, now going back to the. We were looking at the sources document today, right? So let's take a look at that assignment. Oh, okay. So now it's open for anybody to turn it in. I screwed it up. Sorry. I did the wrong thing. All right, I understand. See, you see how technology makes your life so much easier? All right? So that way you can still turn it in, but it'll be marked late. And if it's marked without a code, then you can't get any credit. What happens if you do get a code? How much credit can you get? Did you guys read my announcements? You should read the stuff that I send you. I send it to you for your information. It's helpful to you. So if you turn in your work late, how much credit can you get? Full credit as long as we come to the late. Like come to you for help after class. Exactly. You see? You see how generous that is, right? But I really want you to turn your work in on time because it's for your benefit to do it. Okay? Questions? Comments about anything. All right, let's go then back to the slide set here. Now you guys can see the slides, right? Is that right? Yes. Okay. And remember that we were talking last week when we ended. We were talking to conquest with Tenochtitlan and how the Spanish were able to finally conquer Tenochtitlan. But that the story that we maybe learned when we grew up about the conquest of Mexico and the Spanish under Cortez, that Cortez and 600 intrepid Spaniards were able to conquer the Aztec empire, The reality of it was that Cortez and 600 intrepid Spaniards and hundreds of thousands of natives and a number of fresh recruits from. From Spain and advanced weapons, ships, and disease, wouldn't you say? And Montezuma himself for letting them all the way in and letting him himself get captured by Cortez. You know, you could say that, I guess, but there was no indication that Cortez, in fact, big accident, if you think about it. We're all at peace until Pedro de Alvarez decided to have a massacre in the. In the temple. Right? So. So the. It was kind of, I guess, the. The way that you could say. The problem with looking at what you're saying and although it's, you know, likely true is that. Is that in history we can't really know what might have happened. We only know what did happen make sense. So the question about what if? It's a great question and it's. It leads to a lot of respection, but it's not really something that as historians, we can make any sense of one way or the other. Does that make sense? Okay, so anyway, I'll go along with. We could say Montezuma. But the main thing is to say that it wasn't that the Europeans were so advanced that, you know, that the natives just didn't stand a chance. Okay, that's. I mean, the reason why I say it that way is because technologically that was true, but it wasn't because they were white Europeans. It was because they had developed technology that the natives had not. And that technology that the Europeans had. Had developed, had been developed by other peoples of that time as well. You guys get what I'm saying? So it wasn't like there's some inherent. Something inherently superior about white Europeans over Native Americans. Does that make sense? You guys. You guys get what I'm saying? All right, well, anyway, so Tenochtitlan fell, and then what happens is that the rest of the Mesoamerica and really the rest of the Americas open up to Spanish exploitation. And one of the things. One of the ways that the. One of. One of the ways that the Spanish were able to administer their empire was through a. A institution called the encomienda, okay? Now, the real meaning of encomienda is a gift, okay? And what comienda came to be in the Americas was a grant of the use, a plot of land, okay? So now when we go back and think about when we talk conquest of the islands with the conquest of Eola and the conquest. And then the. The people who performed accomplished that conquest received rewards, and the leaders of those expeditions received encomiendas, okay? And what that meant was that they were given rights to an area of land that they could use to gain wealth, okay? But now keep in mind that when they conquered Hispaniola and they conquered Cuba, there wasn't. There weren't any mines, there wasn't any gold. There was a little bit of gold in Cuba, but not much. Right? And so what that meant was that the person who was in control of the encomienda, or as we will call him, the encomendero. Right, for me to spell that for you. I will. Encomendero, had control of an area of land and a certain group of people who lived on the land. So it's very much like the feudal system in Europe. You guys remember me talking about that, where the lord actually controls the land, but he doesn't own the land and he doesn't own the people, but what he has to the people's labor, right? And so that the incomedia in the encomienda is rights to the people's labor, okay? But the problem is that in many places, that labor was, first off, it wasn't very productive, Right? They found that they could actually grow plantation crops in the islands. Sugar, the main crop. Right? But the problem that the labor was not factory, and the reason why the labor wasn't satisfactory was the natives did not make good. They didn't. They weren't good workers, According. They weren't plantation workers. Right. But beyond that, there was a problem with the natives and were dying. What's the problem? Why were the natives dying? European sickness or disease. Exactly. There were diseases that the Europeans had that the natives had no immunity to yet, okay? And so there was a massive decline in population in The Americas. Some people say that it may have fallen by as much as 90% the population of America. Okay? And so if you reduce the population to one tenth, that would mean that the population decimated, right? Do you understand where that word comes from? Now, decimated means 1 10th, okay? But it's really destructive. And the end of it was that the encomienderos had gained use of land that was not very productive, wasn't making them wealthy, and the wealth that they were receiving from it was diminishing over time, right? Because their labor was all dying. And. And then we got it. On top of all that, keep in mind that the Spanish is an urban culture, and Spaniards did not want to live out on plantation nowhere to make money what they want. The conquistadores came to America to gain wealth, but then not so that they could live in America, but so they could take that wealth and go back to Spain and live like hidalgos, right? Sons of something, right? And so this was. Had really interest in maintaining these plantations. And so what. And with the fact the natives were actually dying, what they did, one of the practices that they did was that they would force the Indians to work themselves essentially to death, right? They were brutally enforcing or exploiting the natives to gain as much wealth as they possibly could before the natives died. Okay, you guys, follow me here. All right. Well, in the middle of all, there was a Spanish priest, Bartolome de Las Casas. He looked at this situation and he believed that the nymphs were rational human beings and that they should. They deserve the king's protection and that the king should not allow them to be worked to death so that these conquistadores could make money, okay? Ends up writing a book. And the name of the book, we call it in English, the Destruction of. And we get the first taste of what I told you guys last week is called the Black Legend. The black legend is that the Spanish came and they were brutal and they exploited the natives and they took all their stuff and they destroyed their culture. All that was true, but it wasn't true. It wasn't the intention. Right. Because of various factors. At any rate, the point is that what Bartholomeg Las Casas writes is that the reasons why the Indians are dying is because exploited, and that they should. That they keep intervene and not allow. That's what this book essentially says. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? All right, well, the first thing we have to say is that Bartholomew Las Casas wasn't exactly correct. The Indians weren't dying because of Exploitation. They were dying because of disease, but they were being put in because of the fact as harshly as they were because of the fact that they were dying of diseases. But at any rate, the point here is that there's somebody. Somebody wrote a. Another counter argument to this, his name. And I. I wish I had written this down. I didn't, but his name is Juan. He names. Right, so what I want you to write down is S E P U with an accent. L, V I D A Sepulveda, just kind of like Sevo Drive in la. Right, you guys are with me. Okay. And what Secluda argues is that the natives are not fully human, that they are in a level below white Europeans, a level of humanity below white Europeans. And there is a. This is kind of a European concept, but there are tiers of humanity and that what. One of the things that really marks these tears is skin color. Right? So from the point of view of Europeans, if you're white, then you're close to the top tier of civilization, and then the darker that you get, the farther away from, or I should say, the more primitive, I guess you could say, you become. Right? So white people are the. At the top of the. At the top of the pyramid, essentially, and black people are at the bottom. Right. That's a European concept of the tiers of humanity. Right? That's T I E R S, not T E A R s. Right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, so now. So now what. What Sepuba argued was that the. The whites were here and the natives were down here. Sorry. But he argued that with education, they could be made to be human. Right? So what Sepulveda argued was that the natives are less than human, but they can become human, and that the way to become human is to be educated by whites. Okay, so they could be educated into essentially into whiteness. Right. Or into humanity. And so what Chapubra argued was that the price that they had to pay for this education was labor. Okay? So from Las Casa's point of view, the encomienda was a sin essentially against humanity. And he argues to the king that he can't, that he shouldn't allow it. But what Sepulveda. His counter argument is that it's not a sin, that it's actually a favor to the natives, but the natives have to pay by labor, and that labor is accomplished through encomienda. Right. So there you have two arguments, one in favor of one opposed to the encomienda system. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments about this, all right? So there. There is a debate in the 1540s in a place called Valladolid in Spain. I'm gonna just. I'm gonna show you a video. No, I'm gonna. I mean, there will be a video available to. That talks about this, among other things. But the problem is that the video is a BBC video. So they mispronounce all the Spanish words. So instead of saying sepura, they say cepo veda, and instead of saying Valladolid, they say Valladolid or something like that. Right. So at any rate, the point is that it's a city in Spain, and the king brings Bartolome de las Casas and Juan Jines de Sebubera to Valladolid to argue. To debate over the nature of the Indians. All right, so now, what's really interesting here is that this is probably the first debate on the issue of human rights. Okay. This is probably the first debate over who has rights as humans. Okay. And what's really interesting about this is that the king eventually decides that Las Casas is right. That Las Casas, when he says that the Indians are human, irrational human beings and deserve the king's protection, the king actually agrees with that. Now, there's other reasons besides just, you know, humanity. That the king decided that we just have to leave that for now. But the main thing is that he did make that decision. So this is kind of, in a way, we could look at this as a victory for human rights. You guys with me? Because one of the things he does is he outlaws the encomienda, and he actually separates the natives into a different group. Group that's not under the colonial authority, but rather under the king's protection. Right. Which means that they can't be exploited for labor. And he passes a number of laws called the New Laws of the Indies. And these laws restructure the administration of the colonies, taking the administration of the colonies out of the hands of the conquistadores. Right. You guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. So this seems like it's a win for human rights, but like everything else in history, it's not that simple. Because now that the Spanish can no longer use native labor in their plantations and in their mines, they still need labor. So if they can't use natives for labor, where are they going to get this labor? African slaves. Exactly. And so this is going to be what prompts the transatlantic slave trade. And I think we talked briefly earlier about how the transatlantic slave trade transported as many as 15 million slaves from Africa to The Americas. Okay? So on the one hand, it's a win for human rights, and on the other hand, it's a tragedy on the scale of the Holocaust or worse. Right, you guys are with me. Questions, Comments about this. All right, so anyway, so that's the encomienda system. I'm done with that now. So are there any questions at all about anything that has to do with the conquest of Mexico right now? Because if there aren't, we're going to discussion. You guys are all good. All right, so now you guys read the documents that I gave you, right? Yes. And you all answered the questions, Right? Okay. So now what I want to do, I want to. Before we do anything else, what I. The focus of what we're going to do for the rest of this class is historiography. Have you guys ever heard of historiography before? No. Okay, well, historiography essentially is the practice of doing history or the study of historical writing. Okay, so when we think about. When we say history and we're talking about not what's happening right now, but the way that we remember what happened. Right. Where do you find history? You want to know the history of the conquest of Tenochtitlan? Where would you look for that? Good. Sorry, I was gonna say from like, official. Official paperwork from the government. Okay, well, yeah, okay, but I'm talking about now. I mean, we're not going to be looking through the Spanish archives looking for. For documents. We just want to. Want to figure out what happened there. How would we do that? Just any firsthand sources that you can find from the area. Anybody who could write and did right in the times. Okay, you guys are thinking too much like historians right now. I'm talking about consumers of history. Right. If I want to know the history of World War II, how will I learn the history of World War II? Watch a documentary? A library. Watch a documentary. Or I could read a book. Right. It's not funny that that's not the first idea that you come up with, reading a book. Right. But at any rate, the point is, I can read a book. Well, who read the book? A historian. A historian. Okay, so now let's think about something. Let's just talk about this. This issue of the conquest of Mexico. Right. And. And it has a lot to do with Columbus. Right. We're going to be doing Columbus Day in October 12th. Right. And Columbus Day has been celebrated in the United States. Okay. Why do you think that Columbus Day is celebrated in the United States? Because he's attributed to finding America. So without Him. Okay. So he found the Americas, and because he found the Americas, we can have the United States. Yes. And that's a good thing. Right? Okay. Also, you may or may not know this, but Columbus Day was to give citizenship, legitimacy, I guess you could say, to Italian Americans. They could say the Italians were instrumental in making America. Right. So is a lot. When we say Columbus Day, it's really a celebration of Italian Americans, or that's where it started anyway. And just like St. Patrick's Day is a. Is a celebration of Irish Americans. Right? Okay, so. But actually, you know, Cinco de Mayo was also a celebration of Mexican Americans, except for that's just a day of drinking. But anyway, the point I'm trying to make here is that at one point, somebody wrote in a book that Columbus discovered in America was better than a good thing. It was a fantastic thing because without happening, we could not have America. Now, nowadays, there are many places where they won't even talk about Columbus Day anymore. Instead, they call it Indigenous Peoples Day. Right. Why do you think that people talk about things differently today than they did then? More information or context or. We as a society have changed. Right. So what we notice then is that let's say somebody wrote a book about Columbus and America in 1950, and somebody wrote a book about Columbus and America in 2020. Right. I'm sorry. Revisionist history. Well, what we'll notice is that it's a different story, isn't it? The narrative has changed. So we have a historical narrative, and it's current with the current population. But as the population and the culture changes, the historical narrative also changes. Right. You guys follow what I'm saying here? So we call. When you look at how it changes from then to now, that's historiography. Okay? So the way historiography, the way historian does historiography is that let's say the historian wants to write about. Say he wants to write about the conquest of Tenochtitlan. So he'll look at the original documents, and then he'll look at what people have written about it over time. Right? So then he'll look at maybe what people wrote about in 1900, what people wrote about in 1950, and that he'll see how the narrative has changed over time. Okay? That's what historiography is. So when I sit down to write my history, I want to write a history. I don't want to have to just agree with somebody else. I want to. I want to bring a fresh perspective to it, and I can't do that if I Don't know how the narrative has changed over time. Does that make sense to you guys? Questions? Comments? Okay, well, first off, I just realized what I just said, because you're saying, well, if you're going to write history, you just write down what happened, right? Well, it's never that simple, Right? It's never that simple. You just leave it at that. Okay? Questions, comments about anything so far. So that's historiography. All right? Now the next thing we need to think about is another word which has a lot of meanings, none of which make very much sense, right, at first glance, but it's a very important concept. And that word is ontology, or what is ontological? Okay? So now. So you may or may not know this, but any word that has ology in it, right. Is a study of. Right? So what we have here is a study of aunts, whatever that is. Okay? And that's why it doesn't really make that much sense. It's a metaphysical description. But the way that we use it is to say that what's ontological is what is what is embedded in our culture. And because of that, it's embedded in our own knowledge, so that we know things to be true that we might not even know that we know because it's just so fundamental. It's just so basic. Right? So let me try to give you an example of this. Where I got this was from a book entitled Silencing the Past, Power and Production of History by a Haitian author, Michel Rolfe Trouillot. And what he writes, this book is about historiography, or how is history produced. Right? And what he uses as an example is a slave owner, plantation owner on the island of Saint Domingue. That's what they called it at the time. And. And he is close to the time of the Haitian Revolution. Okay, we'll talk a little bit about that in a second here. But the main thing to say is that this is before the Haitian Revolution. So here's a man, he's a Frenchman. He's got. His name is Le Barre, and he is writing a letter home to his wife because his wife would never come and live in a place like Haiti or Saint Domingue, right? And he's writing this letter home to her, and he's saying that they are. They're perfectly safe. The slaves are all content and happy, and that they never worry about slave revolutions at all. Right? Slaves. He says that the slaves can't even imagine liberty in the way that white people can imagine liberty. Keep this. Keep in mind. This is about the time of the French Revolution. Okay, so now when lebar wrote that slaves are incapable of imagining liberty, how did he know that? He must have made an assumption. Well, it wasn't true, but was he assuming anything or did he know it? Did he say, I think that. No, he said the slaves are incapable. Right? So it's not something that he assumed, it's something that he knew. But how did he know it? And the only way he would know it is if he talked to slaves and asked them if they knew what liberty was. And if they, if he went through a bunch of them and they had no concept of it, then he could say, oh, they don't have. No. Otherwise he is just making the assumptions. Okay, well, you're right about that, but I probably. He probably didn't ask any slaves whether they knew anything about liberty. So, so that would have to be an assumption, right? Because as far as he knew that he already knew, they didn't. Right. The question, the, the thing that I'm saying here is that we could call it an assumption, but from his point of view, it was knowledge, it was truth. Right? And what he's writing is the truth. Okay, from his point of view. Exactly from his point of view. But how does he know it? I'm sorry, in reality, he doesn't. Well, in his head, he does. Okay? And that's what's ontological. What's ontological is that we know certain things to be true. We don't have to. Have to. We don't have to prove it. We already know it. We just know that you guys get what I'm saying, okay? So, so now let's. Here's the reason why I wanted to introduce it that way is because not very many weeks after Lavar writes this letter to his wife, he is killed by rebelling slaves on his plantation. Right? He was killed by the slaves that rebelled in the Haitian Revolution. Right. So he knew something. But having been killed by these slaves, what does that tell us about his knowledge? It was not good. It was wrong. Right? You think that's what, you think that's what he was thinking as he was getting murdered by the slaves? Oh, you know, I think they actually do know what liberty is. Crap. I think he was going, ah. But anyway, the point here is that he, what he knew to be true was not true. But at the same time, what he knew to be true motivated him to live the life that he lived. Right? So, so that's what's ontological. The way that he experienced the world in the world that he imagined or that he lived in that ontological state that he lived in. There was no. There was no chance that there could be a slave revolution, because there had never been a slave revolution. I mean, there had. There's three revolutions all the time, right? But from his point of view, there wasn't. Okay? You guys get what I'm saying? And so he. The way. The only way that he can learn what is the truth is to have somebody irrefutably contradict what he knows is true, right? So to irrefutably contradict what lebar knew to be true, somebody had to kill him with a machete. You guys get what I'm saying? And that is. See, now here's. What's the. Where we're going with this, is that. Yeah. Okay, so. So, yeah, levar had an ontology, ontological outlook that was actually destructive to him. Right? He didn't have any way of knowing. He couldn't question it because he didn't know he had it. Right? But we also have an ontological point of view. We have. If. If we all know inherently, nobody has to tell us that slavery is wrong. We all know that. Right? We all know that. Every one of us. It's built in. So it's not something that we've been taught. It's just something that we know. It's built into our nature. Right? And there's many, many other things that we know that way ontologically in our culture. Right? So one of the things that we can notice, and this actually kind of goes along with historiography, is that the world that people that live. Lived in the time of lebar, was ontologically different from the world that we live in. Okay. And the reason why it's important for us to know that is because we, with our ontological outlook, cannot see what LeVar saw. So if we cannot see what LeVar saw, how can we write about what he did? The only thing we can do is to say, well, he was an idiot. He shouldn't have had slaves to begin with. Right? Because that's what our ontological point of view says. Right. But that's not very helpful. Is. Doesn't help us to learn anything about Lavar or why he thought it was okay to have slaves or any of that. Okay? So as a historian, my job is going to be to try to look at the world through Lavar's eyes. You guys get that? Yeah. You have to. You can't layer over our own morals and values over any piece of history, because it doesn't. That's what. They didn't live in our culture, so. Right. So we have to judge people, we have to understand people by their own perspective. Perspective, exactly. Their perspective is also part of the history. That's true. But here's the thing, though. It doesn't mean we can't judge them. Right? I mean, I can say this. I believe this is true. I, I believe that. I believe that slavery, trying to own another human being, exploit their labor for my own benefit, is evil. Right? And I will always believe that. So it doesn't matter to me if it was George Washington, Thomas Jefferson or whoever weren't slaves. Slavery is evil. Right. But do I think that George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Lamar were evil? No, probably not. I mean, he didn't sit down one day and say, I'm going to be evil today. Right. So we can judge what they did, but we can't, we can't understand it unless we can see it through their eyes. Does that make sense to you guys? Questions? It all has to have a lot of nuance. Like a lot of nuance to be able to go, it's not. Nothing is black and white. It is, well, very nuanced. That's, that's a problem with people who have, don't have very good imaginations because everything should be black and white. Right? History is just the facts. Just dummy the facts. Right, Right. But let's, let's say I think that the, The Padres played St. Louis, right? Yesterday. Okay? I, I don't remember. I didn't watch it, but I was looking at it on the scores. And so St. Louis beat the Padres three times in a row, right? Because for some reason St. Louis, the Padres can't beat St. Louis. Never have any. At any rate, the point here is that let's say that the score of that game was three to two, or whatever it was, I don't know what it was. Right? But St. Louis got three and San Diego got two. Right? You guys are with me. Questions. Okay, well, that's the facts, ma'. Am. St. Louis got three points and Padres got two points. And that's it. That's the facts, ma'. Am. Right. Okay, but now who among us, if we know anything about baseball at all, right? Who am I? Especially for those of us in San Diego, right? I mean, many of us probably are really. Maybe not die hard, but at least we pull for San Diego because they're the home team, right? So if we are from San Diego, you know, we're like, oh, God, it was a horrible game and they lost at St. Louis again, and they could never beat St. Louis. And, and you know, the refs were all playing for, for St. Louis, and they should have put St. Louis jerseys on, you know, whatever, right? But if we go to St. Louis, they're going to say, well, the Padres are stupid. They can never win. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? So, and so if you talk to somebody who was a Padres fan and told them and said, tell me about this game, and you talked to somebody that was a St. Louis fan and said, tell me about this game, you would get two different stories, right? And they're both true. You get what I'm saying? They're both true. And that's the nature of history. History is not that simple. It's not math, right? There's, there's a lot of, there's a lot of ambiguity in, in, in history, in historical research, okay? And if you only give the score line, if you only said it was three to two, you have no idea about anything else about the game. Was it three to two? Like, did they score three in the first inning and then nobody did anything, or was it a battle to the end? Same thing with history. If you just get dates, hey, there was a battle here and these people won. And then you're like, all right, that's it. That's all you need to know about history. Then you don't know anything about it. You don't know anything about history. It really, it's incredibly boring. It would be like sitting down and reading the telephone book, right? I know you guys probably don't know what a telephone book is, but a telephone book is a book that just has numbers, names and numbers, right? And how many of you guys would sit there and read a 3,000 page telephone book? I mean, you wouldn't get past the first page and say, this is stupid. I'm going to go do something else. I'm going to go watch tv, right? Or something. You guys get what I'm saying? So history would be incredibly boring if it was that. And I think that's one of the reasons why many people come to college with the idea that history is boring. Because when they're in, when they're in high school. Well, first off, who taught you history in high school? It was the coach, right? And he was a really good storyteller. He was a storyteller, but he wasn't, he wasn't a historian. And so what did you have to do? You had to remember names and dates, right? Okay. And so you're saying, well, that's a stupid thing to do. Why would I want to do that? Right? And you're right. There's no point. That's not learning history by learning. Right. Learning history is a lot more about. In many ways, it's really learning about who we are. Right. Anyway, so that's kind of my sermon for today. Everybody say amen right now. Next. Next words. Next definition is historicity 1 and historicity 2. Right? Historicity 1 and historicity 2 also come from this book, Silencing the Past. And I haven't heard it anywhere else, but what it does is it gives us a really good understanding of how history, the production of history, what becomes the narrative is a tension between what happened and what is said to have happened. Right? So historicity one is what happened. Historicity two is what is said to have happened. What's the difference? One, it would be like the outcome or the journey. And then two would be the specific experience or perspective. Okay, all right. I kind of get where you're going there. Maybe somebody else wants. So what one is like just the facts, Jack. And then two is what is somebody's interpretation of what went down that day, which could be different depending on each person. Each person and where. When and where they live, all that. Right? So what happened is what actually happened. What is said to have happened is what is how the narrative is created or recorded. Right? So again, what happened was the St. Louis meets the Padres. Right? What is said to have happened will vary depending on who's telling the story. Right? And that's when we look at any work of history, we have to understand that that is a product of the tension between what happened and what is said to have happened. You guys get what I'm saying? Questions, comments? All right. Okay. And then last thing. This is kind of simple, but maybe not primary source. When we think primary, we think, oh, that's the main one. Right? So primary source would be the source I use the most, or something like that. But that's not what it means in historical profession. What it means is a primary source is an uninterpreted document. Right? So let me ask you. You guys read three things, okay? One was written by a historian talking about the nature of the. Actually four things, the first two were written by historian talking about the nature of the sources that you read. Okay. And then the other two were actually. One was a. Was an account from the native point of view, and one of them was an account from. From the Spanish point of view. Right? So now the first two Were they primary or secondary sources? The one by the friar would be secondary. No, no, not. Not the. Not those. I'm talking about the ones that were in the introduction by the. By the historians. The. Well, there was the primary source through. I can't remember what his name is. The. The soldier. Okay. All right, so let's ask question the other way. The. The. The account that was the native point of view and the account that was written by Diaz, were they primary or secondary sources? The one by Diaz would be primary. What about the other secondary? Yeah, the second was the. The native people. The. Right. In the form of. That was also a primary source. Oh, right. Because even though it was produced by that friar, it was actually accomplished by native writers. Okay, because he just translated it, right? Well, he didn't even translate it. They just wrote it all down. Right? You guys get what I'm saying here? Okay, so. So those are primary documents. But if you look at the first part where it talks about. These are the Spanish sources and these are the native sources, right? They are interpretations of those sources. Right? So they're secondary sources that make sense to you guys? So. So now let me ask you, Is your textbook a primary source or a secondary source? Secondary. Secondary. Right. Because somewhere along the line, somebody has created a historical narrative out of primary sources that's being used by your textbook. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? All right, so we're. We're done with the kind of introductory material. Any questions or comments about that? Let's talk about. I talked a lot longer than I wanted to, but it's all good for you guys and that you have to talk, right? Talk about the nature of the sorcery. And you guys read about this, right? But in terms of the accounts of the conquest, there was one account by Gomera, who was Cortez's secretary. You guys. Do you guys know about this? Right? You read about this? Tell me about this. This history that was written by Gomera. It was in the introductory material. He was a secretary of Cortez. Did he. Did he ever go to America? I don't think so. No, he never went to America. Right. And he wrote. When he wrote. Did he tell. Was his writing just the facts? Map. How did he learn what happened? He under. Receive through primary. Exactly what was that? Primary? Cortez's letters. Exactly. Cortez and his documents. Right. Okay, so this document that. This book that writes, is it going to be critical of Cortez or. Or supportive of Cortez? It's going to be Supportive. Exactly. All right, and so now here's this other guy, and you probably know more about him, right? Diaz, what he writes, he's actually writing in. In response to Gomera. Right? Because Diaz. Gomera. Diaz says that many of the things that Gomera recorded were actually not true. Right. And so what Diaz writes is La vera Vera Historia de la conquista de Nueva Espana. Right? Which means what? Somebody. Tell me. Somebody here knows Spanish. Tell me, what does it mean? What would you say? Could you repeat that? I'm sorry? Could you repeat it? What is the title? La Vera dera Historia de la quintista de Nueva Espana. What does that mean? Does something history from the conquest of New Spain. Okay, the something history of the conquest of New Spain. But the worthy important word is the one that you didn't actually say. What does that mean? The real story, the true story or the real story? Right, so he's saying, basically, my story is true. Gomera's story is not true. And, folks, historians do this all the time. It's one of the reasons why no two historians will ever record the same thing. Right? Okay, so Diaz is saying that this. This story is what I'm writing is true. Okay, now let's just keep going in, and then we'll come back. I already talked to you about Las Casas and. And the outcome of that. You guys read about the Florentine Codex, right? And the Florentine Codex was the natives who were educated by the Church, who were writing under the offices of the Church an account of the history of what had happened in the native world. Okay? And so they end up calling it the Florentine Codex. Right? But it's really a native document. All right, now, if you're going to read. You're a historian and you want to decide what really happened in. At the time of the conquest, who are you going to believe? Are you going to believe Gomera, Diaz or the Florentine Codex? Gomez or not Gomez? Diaz. You're gonna believe Diaz? Well, I'm split between Diaz and the codex. Well, because Diaz was there. Right? Go ahead. Go ahead. Aaron, I can't hear you. Can you hear me now? Yeah. Okay. I was just saying stuff into the air. I. I was saying my hierarchy would be the. The natives, then Diaz, because he was actually there, and then Gamora would be. Okay, so why. Why would you believe the natives more than Diaz? I don't 100% know why. I just have the feeling that if I was the oppressed or they have a perspective that's unique to their own, I guess. Right. So that's. That's what you guys are identifying there is our current ontological outlook. Right. If we lived 50 years ago, we would have said Diaz hands down. Right? But now we're more sensitive to the negative aspects of the conquest. In school, say I'm going to root for a little guy, something like that. You guys get what I'm saying? And really, neither one of them is actually correct or neither one of them is actually wrong. Right. I think that you're right to kind of dismiss Bumora because he's only giving us Cortez's point of view. Right. But you got to keep in mind that Diaz, by the time he wrote this, he was in his 70s, right. This was many years after the actual fact. And he also had a bone to pick, Right? Really? One that you know of and one that you don't. Right. The one that you know of is that he was responding to Gomera because he felt that Gomera didn't give enough credit to the rest of the people that were with Cortez. Right. The one that you didn't know about, but you can make the connection now, is that Diaz was an encomendero, right? And now the encomienda is under scrutiny by the king, and he wants to keep his encomienda. And so the way that he does it is to justify what he did. You guys get what I'm saying? So. So there's. So there's a. There's. There's a bias that we can identify with Diaz, and we have to keep in mind that whatever he says is going to be colored by that bias. That makes sense. You guys are with me. Okay? But now let's think about the Florentine Codex, because these are the natives writing. Okay, but first of all, is it really. Well, let's say, you know, one other. One other author has published a bunch of these and said it was the Aztec story. The Aztec account. Right. Was it the Aztec account? Who are these people? Well, if you got to ask, which. Which sect of society. The count within the Aztec empire. Okay. If you. You're right about that. And these would have been the children of what were the nobles in the native society. Right. So would they have the full perspective of what happened? No. Well, first off. Well, they weren't there, Right? Yeah. Because there's children. Right. And they were educated by the Spanish and the Christians. Right. So they would be educated in Christian theology along with their. Along with their, you know, learning Spanish kind of Ontological view. Right. So when they write, are they really writing the native perspective? No, they're writing from. From some perspective that's probably closer to the native perspective. And I mean, they're using the Spanish voice too. So they're not even able to use their own voice. That's not exactly true. They are using their own voice, but that voice has been shown shaped by the Spanish. Right, so. So now the other thing about it is, is that most of the writers of the Florin. Well, first off, who were the Aztecs? Remember I told you they were like a bunch of collective. Like a culture. Right, Like a bunch of city states. No, the. The people who we call Aztecs lived only in Donald Steel. Right, but were there any Aztecs there? Remember I told you about the Aztecs? Were there any Aztecs? No, they didn't use that. They don't use that. They didn't refer to themselves. Yeah, they were not Aztecs. Right. They became that in the 19th century. Right. Okay, but they were a different group. They were the Mexica. Remember we talked about that? Right. So do you think that the people who wrote the Florentine Codex were among. From. Among the Mexica? No, they were plush colleagues. You guys get what I'm saying? So when we say the native point of view, that's almost like saying the European point of view or the American point of view. Right? You think that people in California and people in Texas look at things. Things the same way? No. Right. You see what I'm saying? Just like you said, there was the children of the nobility. So it's not even. Not every class is represented. Okay? So now having said all that, what we've noticed is that none of these sources are really very trustworthy. So how can we use them to construct a. Something that approaches a true narrative? You gotta place it all out there and see what actually connects which pieces of the stories. You can go, okay, that's there and there. Right? Okay. Right. So you can see that there some statements are supported by others and that's more than likely something that really happened. Is that what you're saying? Okay, that's good. Right, but then keep in mind that we all have our own point of view too. So, like what you said, Aaron, when you said I go with the Florentine Codex. Why? Well, because that's our cultural point of view, right? That the natives are important and their voice is important. Okay? So that's going to color what you write, even though you're trying to look at the world through their eyes. Does that make sense, guys, with me. Okay, so I'm going to tell you a little story here, and then I'm going to go. This hasn't been much of a discussion. It's been mostly me talking. But anyway, I hope that you guys are getting something out of it. I hope that you guys, I hope that you're awake. I can't tell whether you are or not, but anyway, I should actually, I should actually have, have everybody raise their hand if they're awake. Okay, Everybody raise your hand if you're awake. I mean, raise your hand on the, on the zoom thing. I don't know how to do that. It's on the, it's on the participants page, I'm pretty sure. All right, you guys are awake. All right, that's good. I'm glad, I'm glad to see you guys are still here. Right, except for Esteban and Luis. I thought Luis was here, though. Maybe they just don't know how to do it. Wait, you guys, you guys did good. You guys can all put your hands down now. I, I, I'm impressed, really. And it takes a lot to impress me. All right, so I want to tell you a story here now. And you, some of you, somebody mentioned it last week. This is one of the most interesting stories about Mesoamerica in the Mesoamerican. The way that the story is told today in Mexico and in Spanish America is that at some point in the past, there was a city that was ruled by a man named. And this man, Tobiltson, was more than just a man. He was a God. Right. He was an incarnation of the Nahuatl God, Quetzalcoatl, or the feathered serpent. Okay. One of the things that, in Nahua cosmography or religion, I guess, is that Quetzalcoatl had been the God who had sacrificed himself on the Temple of the sun, which is right outside of Mexico City. I've been there. Right, and what when he sacrificed himself on the Temple of the sun or. It wasn't a temple there, that's why they built the temple there is that kept the sun in the sky because the Nahua believed that every 52 years, the, the gods had to decide whether or not to, to renew the lease on the sun, essentially. Right. Okay. And the last time that that had happened, Quetzalcoatl had been the one who sacrificed himself to make that happen. Okay. So he's revered in the, in the Nahua world, which is most of Mesoamerica. And it's actually that you can find evidence of that going way back, okay? But now the story of Tohilson. When they associate him with Quetzalcoat, what happens is that he is. He's so successful as the ruler of this city that the demons, Tezcatlipota are. Are jealous of him. And so what they do is they get him drunk on Phuket. I don't know if you guys have ever heard of, okay, but it's a. It's a drink made out of cactus. I've never. I've never tried it. But at any rate, they get him drunk on Phuket and he has sex with his sister, which is obviously a sin, right? And because of that, he is forced into exile and he goes to the. He goes to the east, eventually to Yucatan, and then he. He sails away on a raft of snakes, but because he's the feathered serpent, right? But he vows to return during the year. Now, one of the things that happens is that the acetyl happens once every 52 years, right? Okay. So now the story that's told in Mexico today is that when Cortez arrived in Mexico, or what we today call Mexico, that was the year Sayaka. And so the natives, many of the natives believe that he was either the God Quetzalcoatl or that he represented the God Quetzalcoat. Right? And so now when you guys read these two documents, which one of them has Montezuma saying, we've been waiting for you? That is the native's experience or the native experience. Yeah. Right. Okay, so it seems like. Did DS Say anything like that about this meeting? No, he didn't say anything. Who do you believe, the natives or Diaz? I mean, they believed it. The natives did believe, like you were saying, the. Whatever the. The metaphysics on ology, they did believe that that was actually Quetzalcoatl. Okay, here's the interesting thing, is that there's no evidence that any of that story I told you about the. And the return of Quetzalcoat in the year. There's no evidence of that predating the conquest. So many historians believe the test. That narrative was invented after the conquest, and it was invented by the natives and not by Spanish. Because it's really interesting. We look at the way the Europeans act in the world. They think all the primitive people think they're gods, right? You could see it on tv, right, when, you know, Captain Kirk shows up on a planet and all the natives think he must be a God because he's got all this technological power. But anyway, the point here is that in this Case it was the natives that made it up, right? Why do you think the natives would make up a story like that? To say that maybe. Oh, sorry, go ahead. I'm sorry. Maybe they made it up to, like, make the narrative that they were betrayed. Like, their trust was betrayed, maybe, or. Well, maybe. Right, but. But why would they want to do that? As an explanation of why they. Why the empire folded, right? Oh, we just thought he was the God and he wasn't the God. But we got tricked. Well, I mean, whether you get tricked or not, I mean, if he's God, then it's in the hands of faith. You're not going to be able to speak to gods, Right? And that means that in terms of guilt, you're off the hook. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? Does this make sense to you guys? You guys follow what I'm saying here. Now, when we talk about history, I'm going to tell you right now. Maybe some of you have heard this story before, but many people, particularly in Mexico and Spanish America, believe that the story of C.E. akato and Quetzalcoatl is true. Right? Actually, about that story, he was like, oh, yeah, when the conquest was happening, they thought that was a God and stuff like that. He told me on that. And like. And also because of the horses, they felt like, you know, it has to be a gun. That's what he told me. Okay, but here's the thing, though. We can say that. That that story is at best suspect, right? And so what we've seen happen then is the invention of a history that becomes history. You guys get what I'm saying? You understand what I'm saying, right? So why would somebody. All right, I'm just gonna leave it like that. I'm gonna say it demonstrates to us how history is misused, right? If we believe in the story of Quetzalcoatl, does that help us to understand better what happened? Yes, it does. I think it kind of sways you in one. In one way, right? You're like, oh, yeah, of course, the. The natives, they were just, you know, they just believed in their God so much. So of course this is true. And now that. That makes. And then that helps you explain. Oh, yeah. Well, that's why they were able to get into the middle of the city and abduct him. And this is why it was so easy. It obviously wasn't. There could not have been any other things going on. It was obviously that. It's a good. It's an. It's an obvious trope for so it's, it's more. It's. It's more as a nation building story than it is an actual counter. Does that make sense? It's very similar to the one we made earlier about the Tea Party and the Party Patriots. Right? We say the Tea Party were all about when in fact they were working. No law. You know what I'm saying? Okay. But it helps us to believe that our cause was just right. Does that make sense to you guys? All right, so that should tell you a lot about how history is produced. Do you think that this has been helpful? Do you think that. Did any of you ever think about. Ever wonder how do historians actually create historical documents? I mean, it's not something we probably spend very much time on, right? But did anybody realize how complex it is to create a historical narrative? How many things go into it? You guys see what I'm saying? Questions? Comments? Could the. The natives have used the. The narrative of the arrival of their supposed God bestow upon them the. The rip. The. An enhanced status for them that. That they were. That there were the ones that were visited by the God and that, you know, which. So that elevates them amongst the other tribes or other. The other groups? Yeah. Well, the thing about it is that the Mexica weren't. They were inherent. They actually were inheritors of that history. But that wasn't their history. The history was of another city and they weren't. Remember that the Mexica weren't even from Mexico. They were from farther away. We don't know where exactly. So, so, and, and, and then keep in mind that when Cortez did come, he was. He was not. He didn't act like a very loving God. You follow what I'm saying? So I think the story that they got tricked is a better one than. Than the story that God visited them and then, you know, betrayed them and crushed them. Any other questions or comments about this? I hope that you guys learned something useful and I will see you on Thursday. Thanks, Professor. Live long and prosperous. Thank you. Thank you, Professor. Have a nice day. All right, you guys have a good one. Thank you. And sorry I had to step out and go to the bathroom when you were doing the. Sure. I can hear you. The sleep in your eyes. I'm kidding. Actually. It's okay. No worries. Thank you. Professor, your office hours are after class, right? I kind of. Sorry, are your office hours after class or when are your office hours again? Right now. Okay, cool. So I was the one that didn't know when the time was due. For the natures of resources, huh? So I was wondering, could I get the code? I'm pretty much done with it. I just need to do like. I need to finish up some things, but it's going to be turned in late. I also need the code. It's done. I just. I didn't get it turned in on time. Just hold on a second. Okay? Yeah, I need the code too. I was setting up my router so I couldn't turn it in. I got like this new 900 megawatts router. That's what. That's one of the things that's great about. One of the things that's great about technology is you can always blame technology. Sorry. Let's see. Okay, so now this is for Conquest Documents, right? Yep. Yes. Just hold on a second. Professor, can I also get the code to turn it in? Okay, so hold on a second. All right, so who's first? Give me a name. Trish. Felix. Your code number is 700941. 7004. No. 7009411. Okay, so 700941. 700941. Okay, thank you. I got it. All right. Thank you, Professor. Have a good day. All right, who's next? Deanna Hilliker. All right, your number is going to be 70094 gas 2. Alrighty. Okay. And I just like type that in like just above, like put it somewhere on the top of your document so I can see it. Okay, who's next? Thank you. Yeah, who's next? Yeah, I can go next. Professor, what's your name? Luis. Luis. Luis, yeah. Luis what? Luis what? Jimenez. J I M E. Okay. Yeah, I got it. I didn't hear you the first time. I think my. I think my connection. But you're going to be 700943. Okay, anybody else? Elvin Herman. Professor, what's your name? Elvin Furman. 70094. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. All right, anybody else out there? Christian Lansing. Oh, do you want one too? Yes. All right, you're 700945. Thank you, Professor. All right, is there anybody else out there? Is there anybody in here?

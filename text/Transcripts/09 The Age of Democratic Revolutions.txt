Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Sam. Welcome, my son. Welcome to machine. Where have you been? It's all right we know where you been. You've been my blind filling Italian provider the toys scouting for you know. You know what? It's ra. Sa. It's all right we told you what to dream. You dreamed of a big star. You guys like my song? I thought it was coming from my computer when I joined. Really? Yeah. I thought I accidentally started playing Pink Floyd. Ah, you like Pink Floyd? Yeah, one of my favorite. How could you not? How could you not really? Exactly. Okay, so does anybody want to try and guess why I played that particular song today? Because it is related to England and the industrial age and the capitalism behind that kind of. It's a. It's the welcome to the Machine. And we're going to be talking about the machine today. And so it always seems like an appropriate song. Is there any questions. Are there any questions or comments about anything that I can help you with before we get started? You guys are all. Okay, let me. I would. I do want to do one thing here. I want to show you a couple of things on the canvas page. The first one is I did add from last week, an extra credit. I read an article in the LA Times over the. Over the weekend, I guess. Yeah, over the weekend. And it talks about Haiti. So if you want to do it, it's extra credit. You can get 20 points for it. But remember that there's no extensions on extra credit. So if you don't turn it in on time, you just can't get credit. Okay, so the other thing then is that I added this assignment, the Communist Manifesto. What I'm asking you to do is to read the first. Essentially the first half of the Communist Manifesto. There's the book. You guys can see the book, or not really. There it is. It's like one of those books that does. It's like stealthy. But if you. It's only. It's like. It's only that big, and you only have to read this much of it. So it's a very. It's an easy read. And then there's some questions that I want you to answer these questions because. Well, I want you to answer questions before class on Thursday because we're going to discuss this document on Thursday. Let me just mention to you guys right off, right up front, that I am not a Communist. Okay? I know that there. I know. I Personally know that communism cannot work as theorized. Okay? So if anybody wants to ask me why that is, we can do that later. But for now, just, just understand that we're reading this because of the impact that it has on world history, not because I'm trying to indoctrinate you guys in communism. Okay, you guys got me here. Questions, Comments about this? All right, so let's see the. So that's basically it on the. We have. The discussion also is going to be due on Thursday evening. The discussion of the Color of Money. How many of you guys. Oh, no, wait a minute. Was. What was it we were doing? Yeah, the Color of Money. Okay, so that's due on Thursday. How do you guys. What do you guys think of the movie? It's a little intense. You know, I don't know. I haven't done the discussion yet, but it's intense to look. It's different looking at it from the English perspective as well, as opposed to. Normally you hear this stuff from the American perspective, right? Well, I mean, that makes sense because we're Americans generally, most of us, but it does actually give us a very different take on slavery, doesn't it? And racism. Because we think of racism and slavery in a certain way here in the United States, but we notice now that many other places in the world think of race and slavery very differently. That's one of the reasons why. I think that's a good video for us to watch. Any questions or comments about anything that I can help you with, But I'm going to go ahead then, and I'm going to do the lecture. And today, let's just start off by saying if you guys will remember that the big story of the last 500 years is how Europe, which was a backwater, became powerful and conquered the world by the beginning of the 20th century. So I think you may remember when I started saying that if we were to make all the civilizations in the world baseball teams, that Europe would have been the Padres, Right? Because we may like them and everything, but they're not going to make it to the World Series. And yet they did make it to the World Series, and they won the World Series by being in control of basically everything that was worth controlling by the beginning of the 20th century. And then the rest of the story is how they lost that. That control, but how the effect of that control remains today. Okay, so that's where we're going. But for now, we'll talk about how in the last couple of weeks we've talked about the discovery of America and we've talked about liberal revolutions in America and in Europe also. And what that does for us is it sets the stage for how Europe becomes so powerful. And that's going to be summed up in the word industrial revolution, right? So let me. I'm going to kind of walk through this with you today so that we can see the process of industrialization and also the consequences of industrialization. And then later on in the course, you guys will be watching a video about Japan and Japan's modernization, and you'll be able to see that that happened a bit differently than it did here in the United States and in Britain. Okay, Questions? Comments about anything so far? All right, so let's just take a look here then. Let's go all the way back then to the Middle Ages and agrarian Europe. And remember that I'm pretty sure that I have introduced you before the concept of the thief, right? I know I did when I talked about the encomienda, because the encomienda was kind of the new world version of the thief, okay? And so this is an imaginary thief right here. And what you'll notice, although it's not completely obvious, but what you'll notice is that there is a manor here and there's a village, and then there's fields surrounding it, and somewhere in here there's a church. Right? So we have all three elements of the medieval social order. The aristocracy, the clergy and the peasants. All right? And keep in mind now that we said that the purpose of the aristocracy, what was it supposed to do? Protect. Protect who? Everybody. Everybody. Exactly. And what was the purpose of the clergy? To save everybody. To meet, mitigate salvation. And the purpose of the peasants was to do what? Make food, provide food, support everybody. Right? Make food to support everybody. We called the peasants obradores, which means, as I mentioned to you guys before, workers. Obradores means workers. What this suggests is that the economy of the Middle Ages was agrarian. That means that the majority of output of the economy was agricultural products. Okay? And so in that situation and in this social structure, we have these three elements. We have the aristocracy and the clergy and the peasants. But what about the people that live in the cities? There are cities, right? And there are workers in the cities. They're members of guilds and things like that, Right? And they are left out of this concept of the. Of the three estates. And yet it's going to be that group, as we see today, who is going to break this whole thing apart. Okay, any questions, comments so far? All right, so now. But think about this for a second. The way that this was set up was that the lord had control of the fief, and what that it was like the encomienda. He didn't own the fief and he didn't own the peasants, but he did have rights to the peasants labor. So the way it would work originally was that the peasants would work in the fields of the lord, producing agricultural goods for the lord for some period of time. And in return for that, they would receive his protection and also have the ability to use the rest of the land, which is called the commons, in order to support themselves. Okay, so the relationship then was that the aristocracy controlled the land and controlled the people, but controlling him by means of having rights to their labor. Now, one of the things that will happen coming into the modern period is going to be that the landlords or the aristocracy will eventually realize they can't make any money. They're not making very much money by collecting agricultural goods. And so what they will do is they will allow the peasants to do whatever they want and they will collect their reward in rent, right? So that's why today you pay rent to the landlord. You guys got it? Because the peasants paid rents to the landlord, okay? And that gave them the right to live in the village and have this protection and to work the commons. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, Comments about this? Well, now, let's think about this for a second. Because if in this scenario, there's no industry, right? But there is industry, okay? Industry does happen, okay? Because you need to actually make things. You need to make hats and shoes and horseshoes and pots and pans and clothes, things like that. And where that is accomplished is in the village, in the cottage, right? What will happen will be that there will be a certain peasant who lives in the village and he has a workshop in his cottage. And so the industry that he performs will be called the cottage industry. You guys have heard of the cottage industry, right? The cottage industry is where the peasant actually performs some kind of industry, some kind of manufacturing. And so the. The example that we'll use is going to be that the. The peasant uses a hand loom to. To make wool, to weave wool so that he can make sweaters. Okay? So let's say, because the major out. Major agricultural output of England, which is where we start, all this was wool, right? Was she. Essentially, the peasant takes the wool from the sheep and turns it into woolen cloth, which he then uses to make sweaters. And you guys are with me. And sometimes, well, most of the Time. These sweaters are going to be made for the local people. So if you want a sweater, you'll go to the guy who makes sweaters and he'll measure you up and, and then he'll say, come back in a week or two and I'll give you your sweater. Right? And, and so what you end up with in the, in the cottage industry is a small quantity of high quality goods at a reasonable price. Small quantity of high quality goods at a reasonable price. Okay? That small quantity because you only make one at a time because you're working in your, in your workshop. High quality because it's made just for you. And reasonable price because if it's not reasonable, nobody could afford it, right? So they may even, you know, take chickens for it or something like that. It may not even be sold for money because. Okay, you guys are with me on this. Questions, comments about this. All right, so, so now I. We did want to. I did want us to remember mercantilism. Somebody tell me, how about, let's say, Eric Diaz, tell me what mercantilism. Isn't it like the merchants selling stuff? Yes, it is. But actually I talked about mercantilism when I talked about the transatlantic trade during this period of time. Somebody help him. Somebody help out Eric. Remember I talked about transatlantic trade. I said the colonies, who can they trade with at the. Only across the ocean, right? Only the mother country. Right? Okay. So that's mercantilism. Mercantilism essentially assumes that all wealth belongs to the state and that therefore the state is in control of all the wealth. Right? And in this situation, we're living in mercantilism. And so what that means is that all of the land essentially is the wealth of the nation, right? So the nation or the king owns all of the land. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, Comments? And because the land is the wealth. Okay. And so, and so. So the opera, the output of the wealth is all. It all belongs to the, to the king. The output of the land all belongs to the king. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? The lord just manage. Is managing it for the. The king or whatever empire, right? The lord of the lord. The lord receives. It really changes over time. So the original fiefdom basically was that somebody that helped the king in the conquest of the area that they lived in, going all the way back to the barbarian migrations, right? Would receive a fief in reward, just like the encomenderos received an encomienda in reward in. In the new world. Okay? Over Time, though, particularly during this era that we're going to be talking about during the colonial era, what happens is that the lords basically end up being poor because they can't make any money on these fiefdoms. And so what will happen is that the merchants were making money from trade with America will buy them out. Okay, so, so when the lords control the fiefdom, the lords essentially have, have, have rights to the labor of the peasants up to a point. And that's, that's basically how they're supposed to be able to make their money. Right? And as long as they remain loyal to the king, or as long as they're, their, their family remains loyal to the king, then their, their control of the land remains. But if they were to become, if they were to be disloyal, then they would be replaced with somebody else. Does that answer your question or did I just kind of skirt around it? Are you all right? You got that? That's good. Okay. All right, so let's move on then, and let's talk about the process of industrialization. And this is going to be. Let's just think about this for a second. I'm going. I want you to keep in, in mind this vision of the thief. I don't understand the comment. I'm sorry, is that a question? Whose dog is barking? Yeah, somebody's dog's going wild. Okay, so now keep in mind we're, we're still working on this fiefdom, right? And even though you're not seeing a picture of it anymore, but remember that at this time, what has happened is that the, the Europeans have come to America and they have been able to extract wealth from America. And in the beginning, we remember that the Spanish came to America. The Spanish were able to extract enormous amounts of wealth, but they squandered that wealth fighting the wars of the Reformation, religious wars. By the time we get to the 18th and 19th century, that's the 1700s and the 1800s, Spain has been in decline for some time. Spain is actually no longer really a world power, although it's not dead yet either. But what happens then is that these other countries, particularly England and France, are going to establish colonies in America, in the Caribbean and in North America and in South America, where private people are going to be able to make lots of money, right? And mostly, most of the money that they make in America is going to be from the sale of agricultural products, right? Plantation agriculture, like sugar, coffee, tea, molasses, things like that. Rum. Okay. All those different things are going to be coming from America. And the people who are doing it are the people who. Some of the people who came from the towns in Europe and the people who are actually managing this wealth in America are also in the towns, okay? So remember we talked about the, The. The fief, the feudal system, the fiefdom. The towns weren't part of that. But all of this commerce that's happening now in the. In this period of time leading up to industrialization, right? All of this commerce is being managed by people from the towns or people in the towns, right? Now, the French word for town is bourge, okay? In English, it's berg, okay? But in French it's bourge. And so these people who are managing this wealth are going to become known as bourgeoisie, right? People who are from the towns, all right, Bourgeoisie, okay? Now what happens is that there's all of this money that's going into places like England and France and Belgium, right? And Holland and. And the. The money will be used by the people who are. Who are making the money in America, in. Excuse me, in Europe to, you know, buy estates. They'll. They'll buy out the lords on. On the fiefdoms, and they'll have their own estates out in the countryside. They'll buy positions at court. They'll go around Europe and they'll buy all kinds of art, and they'll buy, you know, paintings, and they'll have paintings done of all their relatives and things like that. And when they've spent all that money and they still have more money than they know what to do with, they will invest that money, right? And the money that they invest is going to be invested in technology, right? So this is going to lead to a technology revolution. It starts in. In England, actually. Scotland. Really? Right. Where the. Where the. The main engine of the industrial revolution is invented. Does anybody know what that engine was or the. They don't grow cotton in Scotland. Let me tell you. Cotton is a plantation crop. Is it steam engine? Steam engine? Exactly. Steam engine. I think it was Alexander Watt, right, Who. Who made the steam engine. The reason why he made the steam engine was because he was trying to figure out a way, a more efficient way to make scotch whiskey. But anyway, that's another story. He ended up making a machine that could do what many people. It would take many people to do, right? So if we go back and think about our cottage industry, right? In our cottage industry, there's one person with one loom making one sweater at a time, right? But with the invention of the steam engine, you can, you can move, you can, you can connect the loom, you can connect a number of looms to one steam engine, and you can make many sweaters, and you can make them many sweaters at once, and you can make them around the clock. So you can make enormous amounts of sweaters. Right. And the result of that was that. Sorry. Yeah, the result of that was that you really didn't need to have very much land to make lots of profit. Remember we had talked about how in mercantilism the land was the wealth, but in this new manufacturing society, you don't need very much land to create lots of wealth. So the nature of wealth shifts from land to money. And another word for money is what? Come on, you guys. Capital. Okay? And so capital then becomes. This system, then becomes known as capitalism. Remember, that was what we talked about this briefly before. That was what Adam Smith theorized was that because you didn't need very much land to make lots of wealth, the amount of wealth that was available was essentially unlimited. And because it was unlimited, you should just let people do whatever they want to make as much money as they want. Right. He called it following their enlightened self interest. Okay, all right, you guys are with me. Now. What I want you to notice is that Marx agrees with Smith, but instead of calling it their enlightened self interest, he calls it naked self interest. You have to wonder, well, what's the difference? At any rate, that's for you guys. We'll talk about that Thursday. The point here is that it is now possible to make lots of money with very little land. And so we shift from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing economy that's based. Rather than being based on. On the. On land is actually based on capital. And because there's so much capital, anybody can get rich. Right. It all. The only thing that keeps them from becoming wealthy is their own ability or their own desire. Essentially the, the. The exertion of their. Of their self interest. Okay, you guys follow me here. That's the capitalist ideal. Okay? Questions, comments about this. The thing is that this is going to have. Let me just finish one other thing here and then we'll go back to that. There's also what's known as the transportation revolution because they hook the steam engine up to factory machines, but they also hook the steam engine up to vehicles. Right. So we have steam ships and we have steam trains. Steam. Steam locomotives. Right. And one way we can think about the effect of this is that in, in 1803, how many of you guys have heard of The Lewis and Clark expedition. You guys have heard of that, right? You guys know US History? Lewis and Clark Expedition. What was the Lewis and Clark expedition? Somebody tell me. They explored the west coast of America. Right. They went from there, was a long journey. They started in Pittsburgh and they ended up. Where did they end up? Go ahead. I'm not sure where they ended up, but didn't they take Orton? They're like a Native American that went along with them or something like that. Well, that was when they met the Kajawea. Right. Didn't they end on Oregon? Yeah, it was actually in Oregon, but it was. Today it's Washington. They were looking. Oregon Territory. Okay. They were looking for them. No, they weren't really looking for that. They were just trying to figure out what was out there. Okay. And so they went. They went from Pittsburgh, they went to the west coast, spent the winter on the west coast, and ended up coming back when they ended up in Louisville, Kentucky. Right. So the whole journey took them a year and a half. Right. So that means. I mean, that's how enormous. Of course, you got to keep in mind that they probably couldn't have picked a worse trail to follow going across country. But nevertheless, it took that long for them to get from the east to the west and back. Okay? But in 1865, the United States opened up the transcontinental railroad. That meant that you could go from Chicago to Sacramento in a week. Do you see the difference from almost a year to get from the middle of the country to the end of the country to a week. That's an enormous difference. Okay? So if we were to look at it in terms of numbers, in 1800, the world worked at essentially 3 miles per hour. That's because the roads were terrible, if there were even roads. Okay. And if you wanted to get something from somewhere to somewhere else, you had to drag it across open country, essentially. Right? Okay. And so to get from one area to another area took three, essentially three miles per hour, or you could go at least three miles per hour. And then. And then if you were going to a far distant place like East Asia, it would take a long time. Because what was getting you there? What was the motive power? Wind. Right. You can't even always count on the wind being there. Right. So essentially we could say, on average, the world worked at about 3 miles per hour. Okay? But now with the invention of the steam engine, with the steam locomotive and the steam ship, the world. The average speed of the world becomes 25 miles per hour. Right? Now, you guys probably think well, 25, that's really slow. But if you're on the 405 in LA and you're going 25 miles an hour, you're good. You're doing good. Right? Okay, so, but the point here, though, is that if you think about just in terms of number, the speed of the world was eight times faster by 1840 than it was in 1800. You guys got me here, okay? The effect of that, essentially, is that the world becomes eight times smaller because it doesn't take as long for Europeans to go to different parts of the world, like India and China. Okay? And the result of that is that the Europeans will be able to project their power more easily around the world. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about that? This is going to have an enormous effect, all right? So at any rate, now what happens is when we start, when we change to a manufacturing economy, that means that the real, the structure of society itself is going to change. Because we'll remember that in the feudal system, we had the lords and the peasants, right? But in this. In this new industrial world, the. The people who are actually running things are not the lords, they are the merchants. Right? And what do we call these merchants? Because they come from the city, we call them bourgeoisie. Bourgeoisie, exactly. And then think about the people. One of the things you're going to need. You're going to need labor in these factories. And so people who have spent their lives on the fiefdom in the village or whatever, working the fields, right? Because of the agricultural revolution, which we're going to talk about in a couple minutes, are no longer needed. So they're going to emigrate and they'll go into the cities, which is where the factories are. They'll go. They'll. They'll go to work in the factories. Okay? Now, but when they come to the factories, what do they bring with them? Do they have their own tools? They don't have anything. Right. The only thing that they have is their labor. Right? So, so what happens then is that these people who we would call peasants, the peasants at least had their own tools, right? And so we could think of those tools as the means of production. Right? So if I'm the peasant that makes sweaters, then my loom is the means of production, right? And if I own the loom, that means whatever surplus I can get from using the loom belongs to me. You got it? But in this situation, we have the bourgeoisie who owns the factory. He owns the means of production, but the worker who we're Going to call. It's a brand new class, it's never existed before, called the proletariat. Right. The proletariat will own only their labor. So the initial situation that's created by industrial capitalism is that the bourgeoisie owns the means of production and therefore gets the surplus from production. And the proletariat owns only their labor and they receive a subsistence wage for their labor. Okay, when I say subsistence, I mean just enough. So if it takes a nickel a day to live, you get a nickel. If you don't get a work, if you don't go to work, you don't get the nickel and you don't live. That's just the way it is. Right? Okay, so it's not like, it's not like if you lived, if you were a worker, you could get minimum wage and you could get, you know, cable TV and a car and, or a bus pass or whatever. None of that stuff. You'd have nothing essentially. Right. So. Or actually less than nothing sometimes. So the point here is that this ends up being a kind of an exploit. Not kind of. It was an extremely exploitative system. Right, but for now, and we'll talk again about that in a little while and then next on Thursday. But for now, what we want to notice is that in this new manufacturing system, the factory system, we can create a large quantity of medium quality goods at a low price. So remember, in the cottage industry, we created a small quantity of high quality goods at a reasonable price. Here we create a large quantity because we can make a lot. You can make them 24 hours a day. Medium quality because it's no longer made just for you. It's made, it's made in standard sizes. Right? So if we were to go to targets today and buy a shirt, you could either, you could either buy small, medium large or extra large. Right. And depending on. I mean, nobody's fits exactly in those sizes, but it's close enough. That's the way we see it. Right. But anyway, the point is it's medium quality. And because you make so many of them and because the laborers are so available, they don't have to pay them anything. So basically you can buy these goods at a very low price. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this? Okay, so that's the process. Then I have a question. I meant to ask it earlier. Is an ironclad than steam powered or is it like different? Is, is it coal? Is that what powers steam power? Generally either coal or wood. Right. What you have to do is you have to have a furnace that creates the heat that makes the ironclad created then during this time period for faster. Yeah, yeah, it was in the early. It was in the early, early half of the 19th century. Oh, they used it. They used. They used a few of them in the American Civil War. So they came up with the idea before time, but they enhanced it later on then to come up with the ironclad and better things. Well, yeah, what we think of as ironclads, they had steam engines. Yeah. Okay. It was very dangerous, actually floating around out in the middle of the ocean on top of it, essentially on top of a bomb. Because they blow up sometimes. But no, seriously. But anyway. All right, so let's. Is that answer your question? Yeah. Thank you. Okay, good. Okay, so now what I want to talk about is this process of proletarianization. Right? Okay. So basically I've already described this. Ownership of the means of production shifts to the factory owners, who we call the bourgeoisie. And because they own the means of production, they receive the surplus. Right. And then the proletariat who are going to be coming from the land, from the fiefdoms, essentially, they only own their labor and so they receive a subsistence wage. So this creates a two class system. Essentially two classes, Right, of the people who are well to do and the people who are poor, the working poor. Right. That's essentially what these two pictures show you. All right, questions, Comments about this. All right, well, now let's move on to the issue of modernization. Okay, you guys have probably heard the term modernization, but I think it's probably a little different from what you are used to thinking about or the way you used to think about it. Let's just go ahead and start with that. I'm going to define modernization as to look like the West. What that means is that a country has an industrialized economy and a liberal government. All right, so industrialized. We just talked about what was an industrialized economy. And we're going to talk about in a few minutes why industrialization leads to democratization. But remember we talked about earlier what we mean when we say liberty with an exclamation point. It's three different things. What are they like? Freedom to produce, freedom to make money. I remember. I don't remember exactly. Well, that's part of it. That's capitalism. Right. Capitalism was the third one. Laissez faire capitalism. Laissez faire. Right. So that was. That was the third one. The first one though was what? One person, one vote. Democracy, Sovereignty. Democracy. So democracy. And then There was one in the middle that had to do with religion. What was that? Secularism, democracy. Secularism, capitalism, don't forget. Right. Democracy, secularism, capitalism. Because all three of those things together are called liberalism. Right. And liberalism, even today is the dominant political force in the world. Right. So we need to understand where did it come from and what was its effect? Okay, so liberalism. So in order to be a modernized country, you have to have an industrial economy and a liberal government. Okay, There were instances of countries that had the industrial economy, but their government wasn't very liberal. But they were not very long lasting. Let's think about what countries then would we say were modernized countries. Can you guess which countries in the world in say, 1800, which countries had industrial economies and liberal governments? The West. Right. Which one? So the West. What countries? Europe. Okay, what part of Europe? It's actually not all of Europe, but you're right, it's Western Europe. So we're talking about United States, Britain, France, Germany, Germany, Belgium. Not Spain, not Italy, not Russia. Right, just those. So we have England, France, Belgium, Germany, and that was it. Right. England, France, Belgium, Germany. United States is one of these modernized countries and modernizes in second half of the 19th century, after the Civil War. There's one other country that's not in the, in the west that actually. Exactly. Japan. So Japan is going to modernize around the same time as the United States. Okay, that's a story we're going to tell later. But when we say to look like the West, I mean that in terms of what does its government system look like and what does its economy look like? But it also, from the point of view of the Japanese, makes it what you. How do we look? How do we look liberal, right? How do we look modern? And the way that we do it is we adopt Western styles. This is the old, the, the, the traditional Japanese style, right? A samurai, essentially. But these guys are the ones who are the, the modernized ones. You guys get what I'm saying? So modernization is going to be associated with Europe and the United States, Western Europe and the United States. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Okay, we talked about, we didn't talk about this much, but we'll talk about it now. And what happens is, and this actually goes all the way back to the discovery of America. Now, when America was discovered, Europeans gained access to crops that made it possible for less people to feed more, to produce enough food to feed more people. Right? So if you'll recall, I think, I'm pretty sure I mentioned to you that during The Middle Ages, the population of Europe was essentially stagnant, meaning that it was, it was. It stayed constant. Every now and then it would go through a growth spurt, but then there'd be a famine or a plague and it would go back to somewhere around normal. So the population of Europe essentially was stagnant throughout the Middle Ages. But after the discovery of America, they discovered a staple quest crop that made it possible for less people to produce more food. Does anybody want to know what that. Does anybody know what that crop was? Wheat. Corn. Wheat. Well, it was neither one, actually. The big one was they already had wheat, they didn't have corn, but that was something they would get. But the big one was potatoes. I know that sounds very unsexy, doesn't it? Right? But in reality, what happens was the introduction of the potato into Europe made it possible for the European population to start to grow. And it continued to grow from then all the way up until after World War II. And after World War II, it starts to decline. Okay, like in the United States. But at any rate, the point here is, is that this making it possible for less people to produce more food disrupts the agrarian economy. Because now people that had been necessary before to grow food so that everybody had enough are no longer needed. Right. So. So I don't know if you guys will remember or maybe have, have watched or, or experienced the Christmas Carol by Dickens. Charles Dickens. Right. And one. I'm sorry, I was just saying Dickens, one of the things that. Yeah, one of the things that, that Scrooge says in there is let them die and decrease the surplus population. What's he talking about when he says surplus population? He's talking about there's more people available to work than there is work for them to do. You get what I'm saying? This is one of the reasons why the factory owners were able to keep the wages so low is because if one person didn't work, the next person, they could get somebody else to do it. Right? Okay, so what then happens is that because they are no longer needed on the, on the thieves on, in the agrarian. In the fields. Right? And also because the new owners of these fiefdoms, the, the, the, the bourgeoisie essentially are closing off fencing in the fields so that the peasants can no longer work them, then they are going to move. And where are they going to move to? Well, they're going to move to the cities because that's where the factories are and that's where, that's where they're going to be able to essentially Try to find some work. And so they'll move, let's say, from somewhere in the middle of nowhere in England to Manchester, which is an industrial city. But once they get to Manchester, they realize that there's hardly any work there because there's so many workers. So they'll book passage on a ship to America. Right. They'll either go to the United States, might go to Mexico or Brazil, Argentina. Right. They'll go throughout the Americas. And what that will do then is lead to a massive movement of people from the. Or actually throughout the 19th century. Okay, so that's going to be something that accompanies. When I talked about the potato, that is going to be. What's the word I'm looking for? It's going to be supplemented or exacerbated by the fact that they introduced new technologies to agriculture, like rotating crops and things like that, so that they can make more food, but they don't need as many people to make it. Okay, so that's going to be. Then the. Essentially what we see then is that instead of the world or the Western world, the industrial world being a world centered on villages, it becomes a world centered on urban areas, on cities. And we start to see huge cities grow. London, New York, Boston. Right. These are. These are 10 times or more bigger than any of the biggest cities in the world during the Middle Ages. Right. In the 19th century. Okay, questions? Comments about this? Not San Diego. San Diego was still a little baby in the 1850s. Right. This is basically what's going through right now, kind of. They've basically had a late, late start where they. They were basically like peasants. And now all of a sudden they're grouping everybody into the cities and making it all industrial. But they have a huge population. Well, they've always had a huge population. That's one of the reasons why they had one child rule. This is the problem that. This is the problem that China has experienced in that they want to have an industrialized economy without democracy. And what they're realizing is that's not something that really works. And that's why you can see right now in China, you can see the demise in a way of democracy and people's rights, on dissent in China. Okay, so. And it's because of the fact that you need to have an educated workforce in order to be able to compete in an industrial world. Okay, does that make sense? Any questions? Comments? Does that answer your question, Seamus? Okay. All right. So now let's think about this for a second. Capitalism leads to a wider distribution of wealth before the only people that could be wealthy were the people who owned the land. But now you don't need any land in order to create lots of wealth. So that means that more people can be wealthy, right? But now if more people can be wealthy, what does the golden rule tell us about political power? First off, what is the golden rule? Person that controls the wealth has the power, right? Whoever has the gold makes the rules. Right? So that's not the one that you maybe learned in church, but this is the one that actually rules the world. Okay, the golden rule. Whoever adds to gold makes the rules. Right? And because more people own the gold, more people are involved in making the rules. Right? So just think about, in your own experience with US History, who were the American revolutionaries? American revolutionaries were not nobles, they were property owners. Adams, Washington, Jefferson. Right? And so they were the. They actually had wealth, okay? And because of that, they essentially set up a system where they rule. Okay? If you think about, I mean, you think about when the Constitution was first in effect, most people were left out. Most people couldn't participate, right? It was only the wealthy. And we always say property owning white males, and we say that as if property owning white males is a bad thing to be. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, I don't know. But the main thing here is that it was only because property, property owning white males were the only ones. Wait a minute. Property owning white males were the only ones who could hold wealth, essentially. Right? And because of that, they end up being in control of everything. Okay, questions, comments about that. Okay, so then one of the things that happens. Okay, let's think about this. Remember we talked about the other day, laissez faire capitalism, right? We talked about how Adam Smith said that because the amount of wealth is unlimited, people should be allowed to use their own enlightened or should be able to pursue their own enlightened self interest, which means that people should be allowed to work to make as much money as they want and that the government should keep its hands off. That's what laissez faire means. Laissez faire means the government keeps its hands off of the economy and lets the economy run itself. The invisible hand essentially is what runs the economy. But the idea behind that is that everybody that can get wealthy will get wealthy. And those people who don't want to get wealthy or are not willing to put in the effort will not get wealthy. That's the way it's supposed to work. Okay? And in reality, what's supposed to happen with capitalism the way that Adam Smith imagined it was that there would not. There would not, it would not. Capitalism would not produce a two class system with a wide gap, right? Like we see the bourgeoisie in the proletariat. And the reason why is because as soon as somebody started making lots of money, somebody else would come up with something a little bit better and that would take away some of the first person's clout, I guess you could say, in the marketplace. So because of competition, there would never emerge this class wage inequality, right? Income inequality. So what really happens though is that the wealthy people, rather than allowing the government to keep its hands off, essentially come to control the government and they use the government to protect their own interests. You guys follow what I'm saying here? So it's supposed to be the government supposed to be completely hands off the economy. And if you ask any capitalist today, they'll say, oh yeah, the government shouldn't have anything to do with the economy except that we want to make sure that they protect our interests. Right? And our interests are, I'm going to make lots of money. So if I'm a, if I'm a, if I'm Big Pharma, I'm going to make sure that the government acts in a way that makes sure that my company, my industry makes lots of money. And if I'm in coal or fossil fuels, I want to do the same thing, whatever it is, right? So what ends up happening then is that rather than the government can keeping its hands off this laissez faire, the government actually becomes the interest of the bourgeoisie, the capitalist class. Right? You guys follow me here. Again, I'm not a communist, but this is actually the way it works, okay? You can look at it and see, okay? But now here's what's really interesting is that people who are capitalists will say, well, the government shouldn't have anything to do with private industry. Pretty much only when it comes to labor relations, right? Because what they're saying is the government should never step in and advocate for the working class. Instead, the government's supposed to be on the side of the owners. You see what I'm saying? So that's that argument that you hear. You hear people who are conservatives and say, well, the government should keep its hands off, right? Well, yeah, if they want the government to keep its hands off, then stop. Stop having the government do your bidding, essentially. Right? That makes sense to you guys? Questions, comments? Okay, well, anyway, that's the reality of it, all, right? I think it's funny that I think it's funny talking about like, let's say fair, like hands off during like the whole, whole coronavirus and everything. We're just like pumping like trillions into the stock market or the economy to try to keep it alive so that it wouldn't go under. But that's the government getting involved in capitalism basically, and other people's. When they should just leave their hands off. Well, yeah, I agree. The thing though is. And one of the things that we'll see as we go further into the course is that laissez faire capitalism is an unconscionably brutal system because it ends up with a very tiny group of people having enormous amounts of wealth and almost everybody else having nothing. Okay. That's the way if you leave it right now, if you leave it unregulated, that's what it will happen. And so what happens in the 19th and 20th centuries is that different governments will, will intervene in different ways to regulate laissez faire capitalism. Right. So in the United States, it was the progressives and it was the, the New Deal, the Great Society, maybe some of the stuff that Biden's trying to do now. Right. In England and other places in Europe, it's government ownership of industries, so that industries aren't able to exploit the people. But the point is that all of these things are moves to mitigate laissez faire capitalism. Because if you don't mitigate laissez faire capitalism, the big kind of consequence of that more than likely would be revolution because when people are dying, they don't just lay down in the street and die. Do you see what I'm saying? Russia, their oligarchs, the, the oligarchs basically took over like the oil and like their natural resources and, and hold that as a monopoly right over Russia. So would that be a less affair than system basically, since the, they're, they're basically the rich? No, that was communism. I mean, it's. No, but communism ended up not working. It ended up with exactly what runaway capitalism is, is where there's a small percentage of people own all the wealth and then everybody else doesn't have jack. Yeah, yeah. So then they're in a lot. I don't really know. I don't really know the Russian system very well. But my imagine, I imagine that there are. The government does provide support for the people. Right. Now I, I know during the communist era they basically gave everybody, you know, apartments and jobs and things like that. I don't know if that's true now. Right. But the government does actually provide support for the people rather than just for the owners. Right? So I would not say that it is. I wouldn't say it was, let's say, fair capitalism, because I think there's, there is some, some limit on what capitalists in Russia can do and definitely in China, because you hear almost, you know, every, every couple times a year, you. So, so. And so the great Chinese industrialist was executed for making too much money. Right. Okay. Questions? Comments? Can we move on? All right. Well, the one last thing that kind of comes from this, then, is going to be the rise of the middle class, or the middle class. Remember when we talked about the feudal system, there were lords and there were peasants, right? And then when we get into the industrial age, there are bourgeoisie and there are proletarians. Right? But one of the things that happens is that because of the complexity of machinery in the industrial era becomes necessary to educate workers. Workers end up going into work with more than just their labor. They go in there with knowledge, Right? And that knowledge is something that they can bargain with. All right? And so what ends up being what ends up happening is a new class that's created. It's a kind of a managerial class. People have to. Have to. Somebody has to be there to manage the factory, to run the factory. Owners can't do it anymore and workers can't work. Right. Without somebody running the factory, essentially. And that's going to be the rise of the middle class. One of the things that you could think about, and this is actually what happened in the United States, is that when the middle class exercises its power, the middle class becomes the ruling class. Okay? So if we look at, for example, after the Progressive Era, the middle class essentially ran. They were the ruling class, I guess you could say same thing in a way, after the New Deal. And one of the ways you can know it, is that people used to, People who were running for office used to try to convince everybody that they were just like you, the middle class. Right, but that's what it used to be like. But do you ever. Joe Biden, actually, that's what he ran on. Well, he is actually working class, Right. Actually, Trump, he is actually working class, but not that he's. Yeah, he's wealthy. But I remember that during the debates, he was like, I'm just like, you guys, I'm not a politician. I'm just one of you guys. Just like you. Yeah. Okay, well, let's just leave that then. And let's. But let's go to this and say, how many of you guys have have heard politicians lately say, oh, you should vote for me because I'm working at a McDonald's or something like that, right? Nobody says that. Okay, except for aoc, right? He used to be a bartender. Right. But at any rate, the point here is that the middle class, if it exercises its power because of the Golden Rule, will be the ruling class. The problem is almost everywhere and now, including the United States. The working class works against its own interests. It supports people who are against their interests. That's something that's called false consciousness. We'll just leave that for now. But at any rate, we could see it in the United States that the middle class was the robust ruling class in the middle of the 20th century. Okay, questions, Comments about this. So that is one of the results then of industrialization is this rise of democracy. Okay, now last thing. What time is it? I better stop. We'll talk about this on Thursday because I don't want to try and rush it. It's very important. So on Thursday when we come together, we'll start off talking about imperialism and then we'll talk about the Communist Manifesto. And basically what we're going to do is go through those. Those questions. And I want everybody to know what the answer to those questions are. Because if I ask Elvin Furman what is the answer to this question, the right answer isn't going to be, I don't know, I didn't read it, or something like that. Those. That's never the right answer. Okay? So you guys be ready. And I think that you'll. You'll profit from. I know that's. That's funny to put that in same context as a Communist Manifesto, but I think that you'll profit from. From learning what communism actually is. All right? At least in theory. Okay, questions, Comments about any. You guys. I'll see you on Thursday. Professor. Live long and prosper. I was wondering if I could talk to you after class. Sure. Do you need to talk privately? I can wait. It's fine. I don't care. Is anybody else wants to see me today? Does anybody else want to see me today? Yes, Professor, I do. Okay. And what about Alec? Do you want to see me? Alex? Probably not even awake. Oscar. Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to actually go into a chat room with Seamus. And then when I'm done, I'll come back out and we'll talk. Okay? Diego? That sound good? I can't hear you. You can go first. Okay, so it's fine. Whichever you guys Arm wrestle. You bring me the Wall Street Journal YouTube Fight to the death. Why can't I. Why can't I talk? I can hear you now. I don't know. I can hear you now. Okay, Just being weird. You want to go or I can go. Okay, let me. Okay, well, I told you to go. So what we're going to do is for me, I just need a code to unlock the previous quiz. I didn't have a chance to do it. Oh, the quiz? Yeah, like from the quiz. You can't get a code. You can't get a code for the quiz. I understand, but you can't. If. Well, the quiz from last week is. Are you talking about the one that I put up on Thursday? Never mind. Then I guess I go shove myself in a boot. No, it's actually, you have until. Well, sorry. Sorry about that. Sorry if I made. You're not able to get to imperialism. Oh, no, it's not you. I don't mind. I'm actually. I'm revamping all these. I haven't done these lectures in 10 years and so I'm revamping them and I don't know how long they're going to take. Eventually I. I would whittle them down so that everything would fit in the hour, but right now it's like I'm just kind of winging it, I think. Well, I could talk about this and this and this and this I'm liking. Interesting to me. So, yeah, I'm liking how this. I just took the first class or whatever the one before this in the summer. And I like the history 100. Yeah. Because that one was just focused on like ancient and classical societies. And now I love the, the whole modernization. I. I feel like in. Even in like school, it wasn't very talked about. Yeah. Well, school history is. The purpose of school history is to make citizens not to learn history. I agree. Wanted to ask. I think there was one assignment that I didn't turn in. I was wondering if I could post possibly turn it in and get laid points or something off of it or able to catch up. Do you ever read the. The assignments that I give you guys? I mean, do you guys ever read the announcements. The announcements? Talk about my late work policy? My, my announcements. Talk about the late work policy. I think it was that I. So basically I forgot. Do you. Do you know which assignment it was? It is the, the. The nature of the sources. Okay. It was an older assignment. 21. I'm sorry for not turning it in. I. I just, I'm juggling a lot right now with. This is my first semester in college and I'm juggling teaching ballet and dancing ballet and a lot of stuff in home life and living on my own for the first time. Okay, well, a lot of people didn't turn that in. Or if I could do. I can do the extra credit also or just some way that I could possibly. Well, no, I mean, I'm gonna. I. I have. I allow turning in late work. I have to give you a code. Hold on a second. Okay. What's. Seamus is your name? Yes. And it's the nature of the sources. You need to write down this code. Yeah, I have it. I have a pencil. Get a pencil. Yeah. All right, it's seven. It's 700949. Okay. Right. So what you need to do is when you turn that in, turn it in, put that code in the top. So I will see that it's late. But if it has the code, then I'm not going to grade it. I'm not going to penalize it. If it doesn't have the code, I won't grade it. Right. You see what I'm saying? Make sure you put the code in there. The other thing is, I want you to go to. Yeah, the other thing is I want you to go to the canvas page and I want you to read the announcements about late work just so you know what it is. Okay. Okay. All right, I'll see you on Thursday. Have a good one. Thank you. I had one quick question. I don't know if this person is waiting or if they're accidentally in. No, I. I'm pretty sure they're not. With the whole Europeans going to America, like you were saying, where they. They weren't employed. Was that similar with Irish going over then? Is that because of the whole effect? Well, the Irish. The Irish. Well, the Irish were one group. Okay. And they came over mostly because of the potato famine. Right. What happened was that it caused by, from what I understand, it's caused by some kind of a agricultural disease. So they're planting potatoes. You know what I mean? It's bug. It was a bug. It was a bug or something, some kind of blight that potatoes wouldn't grow. So they. They took so from the Americas. And then in. In Ireland they were planting them or whatever. And. And that was like their source of food, basically. And then there was a disease. They started dying. Well, remember I remember I said to you that before the introduction of the potato, the population was stagnant. Right. It was only with the introduction of this crop that the population started to grow. And now if you take away that crop, what's going to happen to the population? Yeah, yeah, I noticed. I've traveled to Ireland a few times and I noticed how, like every single meal that they'll make something with potatoes in some way. Like it's always potatoes. Oh, yeah, I know. You, you've heard of it. An Irish seven course meal, right? Six pack and a potato. Yep. Everything that an Irishman needs. Exactly. Okay. All right, good then. They, they, they. So was that around the same era or was it just a little bit after? Well, the. Yeah, it was. It was actually during the industrial era. It happened. Britain started to industrialize in the late 18th century, right around the time of the American Revolution. Okay, okay. The potato famine happened in the middle of the 19th century, around 1840s. 1849, 1847. They actually call it Black 47. You may have heard of that. There was actually an Irish band called Black 47s. Right. But that's what, that's what caused the massive migration from. From Ireland. Okay. Okay, thank you. Have a good day. All right, Seamus, thanks for stopping by and talking to me and I'll see you on Thursday. Okay, take care.

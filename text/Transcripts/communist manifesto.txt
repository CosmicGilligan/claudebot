Have you ever thought about an idea, you know, one so powerful it needed its own anthem? An international one, no less. Today we're taking a deep dive into one of history's most revolutionary and, let's face it, often misunderstood documents, the Communist Manifesto. It's really fascinating, isn't it, how this, well, relatively short text written by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels back in 1848, it didn't just outline political change, it it was a blueprint for a complete restructuring of human society. And it was built on this pretty profound philosophical view of history. Right, And a key part of that is the Hegelian dialectic, which kind of underpins the whole thing. Exactly. We're definitely going to explore that, those core ideas and also, you know, the big vision of an international Soviet. And we need to look critically at what Marx saw as the fatal flaw in capitalism. This idea that capitalism sort of self regulates towards its own destruction. Precisely that. Its own inherent tendency towards, well, collapse. Okay, so our mission here for you listening is to cut through maybe some assumptions, give you a really clear understanding of what the Manifesto actually argues. We'll get into the historical context, which is actually quite surprising, and try to figure out why its predictions, well, why they did or maybe didn't happen as Marx and Engels expected. Yeah. The goal is for you to walk away with a, you know, a well informed perspective on this movement. It undeniably shaped the 20th century and people are still debating it fiercely today. Definitely. So let's jump in. Where do we start? I guess with the philosophical engine behind it all. Yeah, I think we have to, to really get Marx, you have to understand where he was coming from, philosophically speaking. Okay, let's unpack this foundational concept then. Because to really grasp Marx's framework, we need to go back, like you said, to his mentor, the German philosopher Gord Heigl. He wasn't just some minor influence, was he? He essentially provided the philosophical engine, the core method for Marx's anal of history, the dialectic. That's absolutely right. Hegel wasn't just, you know, casually suggesting ideas, he was trying to build a whole system. He lived in the late 18th, early 19th century, a huge figure in German idealism. And his goal, like a lot of thinkers then, was to make sense of history, to find a pattern, almost a scientific formula for how human society and human thought evolve. A scientific formula for history. That sounds ambitious. It was incredibly ambitious. He wanted to explain its progression systematically, logically, not just describing events, but uncovering the underlying structure, the, the engine driving it forward. And that engine is the Hegelian dialectic. So how does it work? Let's break it down. You start with what? The thesis. Exactly. The thesis. Think of it as the dominant idea, the status quo, the spirit of the age, as Hegel might put it. It's the prevailing way society understands itself in a particular historical period. Its core beliefs, its institutions, its ideology. It seems stable, complete. Okay, the established order. But Hegel says it doesn't just stay that way. Right. Something emerges to challenge it. Precisely. Within every thesis, according to Hegel, an opposing idea or force inevitably develops. This is the antithesis. It's the contradiction, the unresolved tension, the negative element that arises from within the existing order and challenges it fundamentally. So you have thesis meets antithesis. And it's not just a debate. It's a real clash. Like an explosion in the source images. Yeah, you can think of it like that. It's a conflict, a struggle. But crucially, for Hegel, it's not about one side simply winning and destroying the other. That's not the point. The conflict itself is productive. It forces a transformation. Okay, so out of this clash, this conflict, something new is born. The synthesis. That's it. The synthesis. It's the resolution of the conflict. It emerges from the struggle. And here's the key part. It integrates elements from both the thesis and the antithesis. It transcends them. It's a new, higher level of understanding or a new state of being. It resolves the contradiction of the previous stage while keeping what was valuable, maybe from both sides. Exactly. And then this synthesis doesn't just sit there. It becomes the new thesis for the next historical age. Ah, so the process repeats itself. It's a cycle. It's an ongoing, iterative process. A continuous cycle of intellectual, spiritual and societal advancement. Hegel had this grand vision. He believed this dialectical process was the scientific formula for the evolution of human consciousness. He thought it was systematically progressing toward some final, perfected understanding of humanity itself. Wow. And ultimate fulfillment. Yeah. He envisioned a final synthesis, a state where no new antithesis would arise because all contradictions would be resolved. The end of major historical conflict, the full realization of human reason or spirit. It's quite, quite an optimistic view of progress, really. Okay, so that's Hegel's grand philosophical system. Now Marx comes along. He started Hegel, right? But he didn't just copy it. This is where it gets really interesting. Absolutely. Tivol shift. Marx takes the method, the dialectical framework, thesis, antithesis, synthesis. But he completely changes what drives it. He radically refocuses it. Well, Hegel was an idealist. He thought the clash was primarily about ideas, consciousness, the spirit. Marx, on the other hand, was a materialist. He argued that dialectic wasn't fundamentally about abstract ideas clashing in our heads. No, it was about the tangible, material conditions of life. Material conditions like how people make a living. Economics. Exactly. Most importantly for Marx, the engine of history was the struggle between economic classes. That was the real conflict driving societal change. It wasn't spirit, it was stuff. And who controlled the stuff. So he turns Hegel on his head. In a way. Ideas don't shape reality, reality shapes ideas. That's a great way to put it. Yeah. Marx proposed what we call economic determinism. He famously stated, and this is key, that economic production and the structure society of every historical epoch necessarily arising therefrom, constitute the foundation for the political and intellectual history of that epoch. Wow. So basically, the economy is the base, and everything else, politics, law, culture, religion, ideas is the superstructure built on top of it and determined by it. That's the core argument. The way society organizes production determines everything else. And the direct consequence of this for Marx, is that all history has been a history of class struggles. At least he specified, since the end of primeval communal ownership of land, once private property emerged, especially private ownership of the means of production, society divided into conflicting classes. And he didn't see this as just one way to interpret history, did he? He thought it was scientific. He absolutely did. He called it scientific Marxism. He believed he had discovered the objective laws governing historical development, much like a physicist discovers laws in nature. This scientific formula, he thought, didn't just explain the past, it allowed for the prediction of the inevitable future. The outcome wasn't a matter of opinion, it was a scientific certainty. Okay, so let's see how he applied this. He used this dialectic of class struggle to explain major historical shifts. Right, like from feudalism to the modern age. Yes, that's a prime example he uses in the manifesto. So picture the feudal system in medieval Europe. That's the historical thesis. Right? You've got the lords who own the land, the main means of production, then. And you've got the peasants, the serfs who work the land but don't own it. A pretty rigid class structure based on land ownership and birthright. Okay, thesis feudalism. So what's the antithesis? Where does the challenge come from? It develops from within. Out of the serfs, essentially, a new class starts to emerge. The burghers, the town dwellers, the merchants, the artisans, the early bourgeoisie. Their power wasn't Based on land, it was based on trade, commerce, early forms of manufacturing. They operated outside the traditional feudal obligations. And something must have fueled their rise, Right? They couldn't just appear out of nowhere. Absolutely. The manifesto points to things like the discovery of America, the opening of new trade routes, the expansion of global markets. These created immense new opportunities for commerce, navigation, communication. This flood of new capital and new markets gave the bourgeoisie the economic muscle they needed to grow and challenge the old feudal order. They started accumulating wealth in ways the lords couldn't. So the old feudal system, based on land and fixed hierarchies, couldn't really cope with this new dynamic commercial force. Exactly. The feudal relations of production became, as Marx put it, fetters on the expanding forces of production being unleashed by the bourgeoisie. A conflict was inevitable. This clash between the declining feudal aristocracy and the rising bourgeoisie culminated in revolutions, a revolutionary reconstitution of society. The old system had to be burst asunder. And the synthesis that emerged from that conflict, the synthesis was modern bourgeois society, capitalism. But Marx is quick to point out the dialectic doesn't stop there. He says this new society, while getting rid of feudalism, has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle. It just set the stage for the next big conflict. So the cycle continues. The bourgeoisie, once the revolutionary class, becomes the new thesis, the new ruling class. Precisely in Marx's time, 1848, the bourgeoisie were the dominant class. He defined them very clearly. Owners of the means of social production and employers of wage labor. And remember that line about the state? For Marx, the modern state is just a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie, its laws, its police, its institutions, all designed to protect bourgeois property rights and the capital system. Okay, the ruling bourgeoisie. So who is the new antithesis, the force destined to challenge them? The proletariat. The modern industrial working class. These are the wage laborers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their labor power in order to live. They are the ones who actually operate the factories, mines and mills owned by the bourgeoisie. And the manifesto paints a pretty bleak picture of their lives, doesn't it? Saying they sink deeper and deeper, become paupers. It does. Marx describes them as becoming mere appendages of the machine, their work losing all individual character, becoming monotonous and repulsive. They're treated like commodities, bought and sold, based on the needs of capital. And crucially, Marx believed their conditions would only worsen under capitalism. Which leads us to the idea of the inevitable Final conflict. Why did Marx think this clash between bourgeoisie and proletariat wasn't just possible, but absolutely unavoidable? Ah, this gets to the core of his critique of capitalism itself. It's about what he saw as its built in self destructive tendencies. Capitalism in a way, regulates itself towards its own end. Okay, let's untack that. Capitalism's self regulation leads to its demise. How? He saw it as this incredibly dynamic force. Right? Always changing. Incredibly dynamic, that's key. The manifesto says the bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production and therefore the relations of production and society as a whole. Unlike previous ruling classes that wanted stability, capitalism thrives on uninterrupted disturbance, everlasting uncertainty and agitation. It has to constantly innovate, find new ways to produce new things to sell. And it needs to expand, find new markets. Constantly. It needs constantly expanding markets. This drives it across the globe to exploit the world market, break down national barriers, force its system on everyone. Marx talks about the cheap prices of commodities being the heavy artillery that batters down all resistance, compelling nations to adopt the bourgeois mode of production or face ruin. It essentially creates a world after its own image. Okay, dynamic, globalizing, constantly revolutionizing. But you said this contains the seeds of its own destruction. How does that work? Well, one major tendency Marx identified is the concentration of capital. Competition forces businesses to become bigger, more efficient. Smaller players get squeezed out. So wealth and the means of production become concentrated property in a few hands. Fewer and fewer capitalists control more and more of the economy. Okay, so wealth gets concentrated. What else? This relentless drive to produce, combined with the limited purchasing power of the exploited workers, leads inevitably to crises of overproduction. These are the commercial crises that periodically shake the system. It's a weird kind of crisis. Not of scarcity, but of too much. Too much civilization, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce, as the manifesto puts it, too much stuff. But the workers who produce it can't afford to buy it back. Essentially, yes. The system produces more than can be profitably sold, leading to unsold goods, factory closures, unemployment, economic collapse. It's an inherent contradiction. And how does capitalism try to solve these crises? According to Marx, he says the bourgeoisie gets over these crises by methods that only make things worse in the long run. Either by the enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces, basically destroying capacity like shutting factories, or even through wars, or by the conquest of new markets and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. But these are just temporary fixes, kicking the can down the road. Exactly. They just pave the way for more extensive and more destructive crises in the future. They don't solve the fundamental problem. So this cycle of expansion, concentration, crisis, this is the fatal flaw. That's the core of it. And the most crucial part of this fatal flaw is that in creating this massive industrial system, capitalism also creates its own executioner. As Marx famously wrote, what the bourgeoisie therefore produces above all are its own gravediggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable. The gravediggers being the proletariat? Yes. The very system that exploits them also concentrates them in large numbers in factories and cities, makes them aware of their shared conditions and through crises, demonstrates the system's failures. And the exploitation itself worsens. Marx argued, the price of labor, the wage, tends towards the minimum needed for survival. As work becomes more repulsive, wages decrease. This immiseration fuels their revolutionary potential. So capitalism isn't just unfair, it's actively creating the force that will destroy it and making that force desperate enough to act. That's the argument. The growth, the crises, the concentration of workers, the worsening conditions, it all combines to create an organized class conscious proletariat ready to overthrow the system. Its own success leads to its inevitable failure. It's a fascinating, if deterministic view. It really is. And this ties into that idea of the international Soviet, doesn't it? That line from the song the international Soviet shall be the human race. That wasn't just poetry. It was central to Marx's vision. Absolutely central. Marx saw the struggle and the solution as inherently global. Remember, capitalism itself was globalizing, creating a world market. So the workers response had to be global too. They famously declared in the manifesto, the working men have no country. Their allegiance wasn't to a nation state, which Marx saw as a bourgeois tool, but to their class and internationally. And the manifesto itself reflected this, right? Written by communists from different nations, published in many languages almost immediately. Yes, right from the start. Drafted in London by German emigres, intended for workers across Europe and eventually America, organizations like the First International, the International Working Men's association, were explicitly about uniting the militant working class of Europe and America into one huge army. So capitalism breaks down national barriers for profitability. And Marx believed the workers revolution would break them down completely for liberation. He argued that as capitalism creates this universal interdependence of nations, it already makes national differences and antagonism start to vanish and the proletariat taking power would accelerate that massively. He stated that united action of the leading civilized countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat. A revolution in one country alone would be too vulnerable. The ultimate goal, once exploitation between individuals ends, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. And then the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end. A truly global, conflict free community. And this wasn't supposed to happen sequentially, like one country, then another. He thought it had to be simultaneous. That was the explicit prediction, yes. The communist revolution must take place simultaneously in all civilized countries. He names England, America, France, Germany, the most industrialized nations of his time. Because the system was interconnected, the overthrow had to be too. A universal revolution with a universal range. Wow. The sheer scale of that vision is something else. Not just changing one country, but the whole industrialized world all at once. It's incredibly audacious. A synchronized worldwide transformation driven by the shared conditions of workers from, as you said earlier, Siberia to California. It really underscores how totalizing his scientific view of history was meant to be. Okay, so Marx, using this scientific formula, this dialectic, declares this global simultaneous revolution inevitable. It's going to happen. But, well, it didn't quite work out that way, did it? If it was so certain, so scientifically predicted, what went wrong with the timeline? When exactly was it supposed to happen? Well, according to the source material analyzing the Manifesto, the prediction wasn't for some distant future. It was meant to be imminent. The text suggests Marx believed it would happen now and everywhere. Now, meaning around 1848 when the manifesto came out? Yes, precisely then or very shortly thereafter. And everywhere, meaning simultaneously across those advanced industrial nations. We mentioned Britain, France, Germany, America. He saw the conditions as ripe, the contradictions at their peak. The revolution was knocking at the door. Okay, so prediction 1848, industrialized west, simultaneous revolutions and the Rial. When and where did anything like a communist revolution actually happen? Well, the stark answer is nowhere and never in the way Marx predicted. 1848 saw widespread uprisings across Europe, the springtime of the peoples. But they weren't primarily proletarian communist revolutions. They were more nationalistic, liberal, democratic. The predicted simultaneous overthrow in the industrialized heartlands just didn't materialize then or later in that specific form. And the big one that did happen. Russia in 1917. That doesn't fit the model either, does it? Not at all. According to Marx's own criteria, Russia was overwhelmingly agricultural, feudalistic in many ways, with a relatively small industrial proletariat compared to the vast peasantry. It wasn't the mature capitalist society Marx saw as the necessary precursor. It was, as the Source puts it, a different thing altogether, led by a vanguard party implementing ideas in a context Marx hadn't foreseen for the initial revolution. So a massive disconnect between the scientific prediction and the historical outcome. Why? The sources offer some critiques. Right. Starting with human nature. Yes, that's a major critique highlighted. The argument is that perhaps Marx didn't understand human nature. The Source suggests there's an inherent tendency towards conflict, that people don't want to share things that I have if they possess them. This idea that nobody wants to be equal with everybody else, that maybe there are innate drives for individuality, status or accumulation that run counter to the communist ideal of a perfectly harmonious, classless society. Did Marx just overlook basic human selfishness? Maybe that's the implication of the critique. Another major point raised is the lack of universal conditions. Marx developed his formula based largely on the experience of 1848 Europe, particularly England, France and Germany. But he assumed this model applied universally. The Source rightly points out the structures of different societies are very different. The specific conditions the large industrial proletariat he focused on simply didn't exist everywhere. You couldn't just apply the formula to, say, a tribal society in the Pacific or a predominantly peasant society in Asia and expect the same result. Exactly. The Source uses the example. You can't go to Maori island and make that happen. Trying to impose a single historical template onto vastly different cultures and economic stages, the critique suggests, leads to bad history, not scientific accuracy. Which brings us to the final Was it really science or was it faith? That's the provocative conclusion drawn by the source material. When a theory makes specific testable predictions and those predictions consistently fail to materialize, but adherents still insist the theory is true, what do you call that? The Source asks. Do you call that reason, or do you call that faith? It's faith. The insistence on the inevitability of communism, despite the historical evidence deviating from the prediction transforms it from a scientific hypothesis into a faith proposition. So when history doesn't fit the scientific model, sticking rigidly to the model looks more like belief than analysis. That's the argument presented. Attempting to force diverse histories into that single predetermined mold becomes problematic. It raises questions about whether the theory remains a useful analytical tool or becomes a kind of dogma. Okay. Despite the predictive failures, the Manifesto did lay out a blueprint, a plan for after the revolution and the absolute core. The non negotiable starting point was abolition of private property. The manifesto sums it up starkly. The theory of communism may be summed up in one single abolition of private property. But not personal belongings. Right. Not my toothbrush, as the old joke goes. No, exactly. Marx differentiated. The target wasn't personal possessions acquired through one's own labor. The target was bourgeois private property. Specifically the private ownership of the means of production, the factories, the land, the capital, the things used to produce wealth and employ others. This, Marx argued, is what creates this inequality, allowing the bourgeoisie to exploit the proletariat. So the communist solution is to take that productive property away from the bourgeoisie and have it held How? Hold it in common. The idea is to abolish the class ownership of the means of production, transferring it to society as a whole, represented initially by the victorious proletarian state. The goal is one class of people who all own the property and all share in the product, the surplus. Collective ownership for collective benefit, eliminating the basis of class exploitation. And the manifesto actually lists steps for this transition, doesn't it? A kind of immediate post revolution action plan. Yes. After the proletariat wins the battle of democracy and becomes the ruling class, the first step is to use its political power to wrest control of capital from the bourgeoisie. It aims to centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the state, that is, of the proletariat organized as the ruling class. This state control is seen as a necessary temporary phase, the dictatorship of the proletariat. And There are those 10 points, the specific measures. They're described as pretty generally applicable. Let's look at a few. Number one, abolition of property in land. Why start there? Land was still a fundamental means of production, especially in the 19th century. Abolishing private ownership of land and using rents for public purposes strikes directly at the power base of the old aristocracy and large landowners. It immediately transfers control of a core resource to the collective, preventing private accumulation from that source. Makes sense. What about number two, a heavy progressive or graduated income tax? That sounds familiar. It does. And many capitalist countries have adopted progressive taxes since. For Marx, this was a tool to redistribute wealth, reduce inequality and fund the state's activities during the transition, hitting the wealthiest hardest. And number three, Abolition of all rights of inheritance. That's pretty radical. Very radical. It aims to prevent the accumulation of wealth and power across generations within bourgeois families. If property is held in common, inheritance of large private fortunes becomes meaningless and counterproductive to equality. Okay, skipping ahead. Number five. Centralization of credit in the hands of the state via a national bank with a Monopoly. That's huge. Financial control. Absolutely. Control the credit, control the investment, control the economy. Instead of private banks directing capital for profit, the state directs it according to a central plan for social development. It's about taking away the financial power of the bourgeoisie. Number six, centralizing communication and transport. Again, state control. Same logic. Essential infrastructure shouldn't be run for private profit, but for the public good, integrated into the overall economic plan. And number 10, free public education. Abolishing child labor. Combining education with production. This seems more universally positive. Yes, it addresses clear social ills like child labor. But the combination of education and production is key for Marx. Creating well rounded individuals, breaking down the divide between mental and manual labor, and arguably instilling the values of the new society from a young age. So the state takes over land, finance, industry, transport, education. It becomes incredibly powerful in this transition phase. But then, and this is the mind bending part for many, it's supposed to just disappear. That's the ultimate and perhaps most controversial part of the vision. This powerful proletarian state is seen only as a temporary tool. The manifesto is clear. When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, the public power will lose its political character. Lose its political character? What does that even mean? Marx's reasoning is that political power, properly so called, is merely the organized power of one class for oppressing another. It's an instrument of class rule. So if you abolish classes, if there's no bourgeoisie to overthrow or remnants to suppress, and no proletariat needing to assert its rule, then the need for a state for political power as organized coercion vanishes. It withers away. And what's left? What's the final picture? The final state is described as an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all. A stateless, classless community, where administration replaces government, cooperation replaces coercion, and individual potential is realized through the collective, not against it. It's the utopian endpoint. But then we come back to that human nature objection. If people are inherently greedy or competitive, how does this stateless utopia function? Doesn't it require everyone to suddenly become altruistic saints? Marx tackles this head on. He fundamentally disagreed with the idea of a fixed, unchanging human nature. Echoing thinkers like Locke, but with his materialist focus, he argued that consciousness is not innate, but socially determined. Man's ideas, views and conceptions change with every change in the conditions of his material existence. So change the society, change the person. Greed isn't inherent, it's a product of capitalism. That's the core belief. If you create a communist society based on cooperation and collective ownership, where the material basis for greed and exploitation is removed, then human behavior and consciousness will adapt. People will become cooperative because the system encourages and requires it. The source notes that all societies, in a sense, indoctrinate or educate their members into certain values. Marx believed communist society would educate people into communist values, reshaping human nature itself through new social relations and education. It's a profound claim about human malleability. Okay, so we have the theory, the predictions, the blueprint, but did anyone ever try to actually do this, even partially? That brings us to the Paris Commune, right? Yes, the Paris Commune of 1871. A really significant, though tragically short lived moment. It wasn't initiated by Marx, but it was seen by him and Engels as the first historical example, however brief, of the dictatorship of the proletariat in action. A real world experiment. And Marx learned from it. It wasn't just a confirmation of his ideas, he definitely learned from it. Engels later highlighted that the Commune experience led Marx to make his only significant correction or addition to the Manifesto's program. The key lesson was crucial. Marx concluded that the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready made state machinery and wield it for its own purposes. Meaning you can't just take over the existing government and run it for the workers. Exactly. He realized the existing state, the bureaucracy, the army, the police, was inherently designed for bourgeois rule, an engine of class despotism. It had to be smashed, dismantled, broken, not just captured. The Commune in its actions showed him this necessity. So what did the Commune actually do during its brief rule about two months? What practical steps did it take that reflected these ideas? It took some remarkably radical steps. It abolished the standing army, replacing it with the National Guard, essentially the armed people. It made all officials, including police and judges, elected, accountable and revocable at any time. It capped official salaries at an average workman's wage, getting rid of bureaucratic privilege. It separated church and state completely, confiscating church property. It instituted free secular education. So dismantling the old state power structures and making everything accountable to the people, that was the thrust. It aimed to be, as Marx called it, the political form at last discovered under which to work out the economical emancipation of labor. It wasn't communism fully realized overnight. Marx knew that. He said the working class understood they had no ready made utopias to decree. Instead, the Commune showed the form government might take during the transition, aiming to abolish class property and turn the means of production into tools of free and associated labor. But Marx also noted it would take long struggles. Yes, observing the Commune reinforced this. He wrote that the working class knew they would have to pass through long struggles through a series of historic processes, transforming circumstances and men. So even Marx, reflecting on this real world attempt, acknowledged it wasn't just a simple formula or an overnight switch. It was a complex, difficult, transformative process involving changing not just institutions, but people themselves. It added a layer of historical reality to the theory. Okay, what a journey. We've gone from Hegel's dialectic of ideas, dialectic of class struggle based on economics, looked at how capitalism was seen to sow the seeds of its own destruction. This idea of self regulation towards demise. Explore the grand, maybe overly optimistic vision of a simultaneous global international Soviet confronted the fatal flaw where the predictions didn't match the messy reality of history, raising questions about science versus faith. Unpack the specific demands for restructuring society, abolishing private property, the temporary state, and even touched on a real historical attempt, the Paris Commune and the lessons Marx himself drew from it. Yeah, and throughout we've seen how the Manifesto, despite its, let's say, predicted shortcomings and its association with later regimes that arguably distorted its ideas, still offers this incredibly powerful critique. A critique of class, of exploitation, of capitalism's relentless, often destructive drive for expansion and profit that, you know, still feels relevant to many people today. Absolutely. And our goal here, just to reiterate for everyone listening, hasn't been to say communism is good or bad, or that Marx was right or wrong. It's about understanding the ideas themselves, like our sources suggest. You should be able to look at them as an idea without being accused of being communist. The key is critical engagement, not blind acceptance or rejection. You need to be able to study all types of topics without being someone who aligns with that view. Exactly. Knowledge, not adherence. Which leads, I think, to a final thought, maybe a question for you, the listener, to chew on. Given that Marx's specific prediction of an inevitable global revolution originating in the most industrialized countries and led by the proletariat didn't happen as planned. And given that the states calling themselves Communist in the 20th century often looked very different from the stateless, classless ideal he envisioned, does the critique at the heart of the Manifesto still hold power? Does its analysis of capitalism's inherent contradictions, the drive for growth, the tendency towards crisis, the creation of inequality, does that analysis still offer valuable insights into our own very globalized 21st century world, even if we completely reject the proposed solution?

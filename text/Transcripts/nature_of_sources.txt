Okay, let's unpack this. Today we're embarking on a really deep dive into one of history's most pivotal and while often misunderstood moments, the Spanish conquest of the Mexican Empire. Now, if you're like many of us, your understanding might be rooted in a, you know, a somewhat simplified narrative, perhaps that tale of a few daring Spaniards overcoming a vast native empire. Right. The classic story. But our mission today is to go far beyond that. We're not just extracting the most important insights from what happened during this conquest and the subsequent profound exploitation. We're critically examining how we know it happened. Exactly. By looking directly at the diverse, often conflicting historical sources themselves. That's right. What's truly illuminating about this deep dive is that it's not simply about recounting past events. It's fundamentally about understanding the how of history. How? Yeah, how narratives are constructed, how they're debated, and how they can even shift dramatically over time as new evidence comes to light or, you know, societal perspectives evolve. We'll be exploring the intricate blend of military conflict, the complex social systems that were imposed, and the indispensable lens through which all of this history was originally recorded and is now interpreted. Right. As you'll soon discover, history is rarely as straightforward as it appears in textbooks. And gaining a nuanced grasp of the sources is absolutely essential for a truly informed perspective. Absolutely. Think of this as your pathway to being genuinely well informed and not just about a hugely significant historical moment, but about the very process of historical understanding. You'll gain a powerful framework for how to critically approach any historical account you encounter, whether it's about ancient empires or the American Civil War or even, you know, the headlines of today. It's a critical skill. So let's begin by challenging that traditional narrative of the conquest, a narrative that often overlooks immense complexity. When we talk about the fall of the Mexica Empire, the story that has often dominated popular imagination is that of Cortes and 600 intrepid Spaniards conquering the Aztec empire. Right. That almost mythical image. It's a heroic, almost mythical tale, isn't it? A small, technologically advanced force triumphing against overwhelming odds. But as we pull back the curtain and look closer at the actual historical record, that narrative truly begins to, well, unravel. It really does. The reality was far more intricate, more brutal, and involved many more players and factors than just Cortes and his Spanish soldiers. It's a story woven with political intrigue, strategic alliances, internal divisions, and devastating biological impacts. Indeed, a crucial point to consider here is that the conquest wasn't Solely a result of European technological superiority. I mean, yes, steel, gunpowder, horses, they certainly provided a significant advantage, of course, but really, it was a complex interplay of native political dynamics. Deep seated internal divisions among Mesoamerican societies, and perhaps most catastrophically, biological factors like European diseases. To frame it simply as a victory due to inherent superiority of one culture over another would be to fundamentally misunderstand the forces at play. It was a confluence of factors, many of which had nothing to do with martial prowess or intellectual advancement. Right, so let's lay out some of the key players and events that shapes this tumultuous period, starting with the man himself, Hernan Cortez. Okay, he was a Spanish conquistador with a complicated, almost rebellious relationship with Diego Velazquez, the governor of Cuba. Right. Velazquez technically gave him the commission, didn't he? He did. Initially, Velazquez authorized Cortez's expedition to the mainland, only to later try to revoke his commission. Suspecting Cortez's ambition, he got cold feet. Exactly. And Cortes, a man driven by immense ambition and, let's face it, a thirst for glory, he just defied Velazquez and set sail anyway. He effectively launched an unauthorized conquest. And Cortes's audacity alone wouldn't have been enough. He needed local intelligence, linguistic bridges. This is where Dona Marina, also known as Malinche, becomes absolutely vital to the narrative. Malinch. Right. The translator. More than just a translator. She was an indigenous woman from the Nahua people who, through a series of circumstances, came to serve as an interpreter and advisor for Cortez. Okay, Advisor, too, definitely. Her mastery of Nahuatl, the language of the Mexica, and later Spanish, combined with her deep understanding of the complex political and social landscape of Mesoamerica, made her an indispensable asset. She wasn't just translating words. She was a cultural mediator. A strategic advisor, helping Cortez navigate treacherous alliances and understand indigenous power structures. And that ability to navigate the indigenous political landscape allowed Cortes to forge one of his most crucial strategic advantages. The alliance with the Tlaxcalans. Ah, yes, the Tlaxcalans. Crucial. The Tlaxcalans were this powerful indigenous group that had maintained their independence for generations, largely due to their formidable military prowess. Despite being completely surrounded by the vast Mexica empire, they had a long standing, bitter rivalry with the Mexica, fueled by things like the Flower wars, territorial disputes, deep seated animosity. Exactly. So when the Spanish arrived, the Tlaxcalians saw them not primarily as invaders, but as an unexpected and powerful opportunity to finally defeat their arch enemies. A means to an end. Precisely. This alliance provided Cortes with tens of thousands of native warriors. Tens of thousands? Yeah, that number is key. Who often fought with ferocity and knowledge of the terrain that far surpassed anything the small Spanish contingent could offer. This is a point that cannot be overstated. It was never just Spaniards fighting. It was Spaniards and their massive indigenous allies, predominantly Tlaxcalans, but also others who resented Mexico dominance. And this strategic partnership quickly led to significant and brutal events. Like the massacre at Cholula. Cholula was a major city state closely allied with Mexico, a significant religious and mercantile center. In late 1519, just before the Spanish marched on Tenochtitlan, Cortes with his Tlaxcalan allies and possibly influenced by rumors of an ambush. Always rumors of ambushes, right? Exactly. He ordered a devastating preemptive strike. The Spanish and Tlaxcalans entered the city and massacred 3000s of Cholula nobles and priests. It was brutal. Thousands, yeah. This event sent a chilling message throughout the region, demonstrating the Spanish and Tlaxcalan ruthlessness and paving a bloody path for the eventual occupation of Tenochtitlan itself. The occupation of Tenochtitlan, the grand island capital. That was initially a period of tense cohabitation, wasn't it? Very tense. Cortez and his men were allowed into the city. Why? Maybe Montezuma II's. The Emperor's diplomatic approach. Maybe fatalism. Maybe a strategic miscalculation. It's debated. And Montezuma was essentially held captive? Effectively, yes. Held captive within his own palace. Ostensibly a guest, but really a prisoner. However, this fragile peace shattered dramatically, largely due to the rash and brutal actions of Pedro de Alvarado. Alvarado, Cortez's lieutenant. Exactly. While Cortez was away from the capital, dealing with a punitive expedition led by Panfilo de Narvaez. The guy sent by Velazquez to arrest Cortez? That's the one. While Cortez was off dealing with him, Alvarado remained in charge in Tenochtitlan. And that didn't go well? No, it was a critical misstep. Alvarado, possibly paranoid, possibly driven by greed for the golden jewels worn by the Mexican nobility, oversaw a brutal massacre. Other massacre? Yes. Of unarmed Mexican nobles and priests during the religious festival of Toxkettle. Right. In the great temple precinct. Oh, during a festival. Yeah. An act of extreme provocation. It completely shattered any remaining trust or semblance of peace. It transformed a tense occupation into open, full scale rebellion. So the Mexico rose up. Absolutely. Enraged by this sacrilege and betrayal. They rose up against the Spanish. When Cortez returned, after defeating Narvaez and crucially integrating many of Narvaez's men into his own forces, he found the city in full revolt. A raging inferno. Wow. What followed was la noche triste. The sad night. June 30, 1520. The Spanish retreat. A desperate, chaotic retreat from Tenochtitlan. Across the narrow causeways, they were caught completely off guard by the ferocity of the Mexica counterattack. Weighed down by stolen gold. Vulnerable. Weighed down by gold. Yeah. It was a catastrophic night for the Spanish. Immense losses, men, horses, most of their loot, Many drowned, dragged down by the very riches they sought. So they were driven out, but not defeated. Far from defeated. That's a crucial distinction. They regrouped with their steadfast Tlaxcalan allies, bolstered by the reinforcements from Narvaez's expedition. Then Cortez systematically planned and launched a full scale, devastating siege of Tenochtitlan. The siege, how long did that last? It wasn't quick. It was a ruling 75 day siege. The Spanish built brigantines, small warships, right there on the lake, surrounding the island city. Ships on the lake? Yeah. Which allowed them to control the waterways, cut off supplies, and launch attacks from all sides. The final fall of the capital under the valiant but ultimately doomed leadership of Montezuma's successor, Quantum Moc, at the last stronghold of Tlatelolco, occurred on August 13, 1521. August 1521. And the numbers involved in that final assault? Not just 600 Spaniards. It's not even close. The numbers tell the real story here, challenging that simple narrative. The final brutal assault involved approximately 700 Spaniards. Maybe a few more. Okay. Still not a huge number, but they were supported by a staggering 70,000 to over 100,000 native allies. 70,000? Wow. Maybe even more. This was a truly massive multi ethnic army. A testament to Cortez's strategic genius in exploiting those regional animosities. Okay. And beyond sheer numbers, we must also account for fresh recruits arriving from Spain. Some literally just off the boats. They had advanced European weapons, cannons, harquebuses, which, while maybe not always decisive in battle, certainly had a terrifying psychological impact. And the ships on the lake? And the ships controlling the lake. Yeah. Something the Mexico couldn't counter. And perhaps the most devastating factor of all disease, European disease, smallpox in particular, swept through the indigenous population before the final siege even began in earnest. Before the siege, yes. Decimating their numbers, weakening their Resistance. It killed a significant portion of the Mexican population, including Quitlawac, the successor to Montezuma, creating chaos and undermining leadership and morale long before the Spanish launched their full force assault. It's hard to overstate the impact of disease then. Impossible, exactly. The question of Montezuma's role, his initial hospitality, his perceived indecisiveness, his captivity. It's compelling for historical speculation, isn't it? What if? Oh, historians love the what ifs. What if he had reacted differently? What if the Tox cattle massacre hadn't happened? Interpretations ranged wildly. Shrewd diplomat, outmaneuvered fatalistic leader, Resistan designed to omens, political captive with no real authority left. But we can't definitively answer those what ifs. No, we can't. But they highlight the deep complexities of human agency. What we do know happened makes it abundantly clear. The conquest was this profoundly complex confluence of indigenous politics. A desperate, brutal struggle for power and the unforeseen catastrophic impact of introduced diseases. Not a simple tale of European might. Not at all. It was a multifaceted tragedy. So understanding the full scope really requires looking beyond those overly simplified narratives. Yeah. Okay. So after the military conquest, as Mesoamerica lay open to Spanish control, a new system was established to solidify their hold, extract wealth. Right. This brings us to the profound exploitation aspect of our deep dive, the encomienda system. The encomienda, the word unkomienda, it literally translates to a gift or a trust. On the surface, that sounds rather benevolent, almost protective, doesn't it? It does have that connotation, yeah. But its reality in the Americas was anything but in practice. The encomienda was a grant from the Spanish crown. It gave a Spanish encomedero, typically a leader of the conquest, so unfavored by the crown, the right to use a specific plot of land. Okay. And more importantly, it gave them control over the labor of the indigenous people living on that land. These grants were essentially rewards for service. Right? Rewards for conquest, Designed to provide the conquistadors with a means of gaining wealth and consolidating power in the new territories. It sounds a bit like feudalism. In Europe, it's highly analogous, yes. In feudalism, a lord controlled land of fief and had rights to the labor and tribute of the peasants living there. Crucially, the lord didn't own the land outright. It was held from a higher noble or the king. Right. Nor did the lord own the people themselves. They were tied to the land, obligated to provide labor. Same principles Applied to encomanderos, rights to exploit labor and tribute, but not outright ownership of land or people. And the purpose was clear wealth, immediate wealth, gold, silver, agricultural products. That was the driving force for the conquistadores and for the Spanish crown itself. And that's where the systemic problems and the truly brutal consequences began to emerge. For one, the forced labor was often wildly unproductive from the Spanish perspective, Right? At least in the ways they wanted. Exactly. Native populations, particularly in the Caribbean, where encomiendas were first set up, they weren't accustomed to the intensive, large scale plantation work needed for European cash crops like sugar, or the grueling, dangerous labor of mining. Different agricultural traditions completely. Their traditional practices were often communal, Tied to subsistence, spiritually connected to the land, not geared towards surplus commodity production for export. When forced into these systems, they didn't understand or accept. Often without familiar tools or draft animals, their efficiency was seen as low by the Spanish. But even worse than the perceived inefficiency, what's deeply tragic, and ultimately even more catastrophic than the unsuitability for labor, was the massive population decline that coincided with the incoming end system. The diseases again, European diseases for which the native populations had no natural immunity, swept through the Americas with horrifying speed and lethality. We are talking about a demographic catastrophe on an unimaginable scale. Unimaginable? A massive decline, with some estimates suggesting a reduction of up to 90% of the indigenous population in many areas within the first century of contact. 90% to, say, decimated here, in its original meaning of reducing by 1/10 becomes a profound understatement for the sheer scale of the demographic collapse in human suffering. Entire communities, cultures, languages, vanished. It's truly mind boggling to try and comprehend such a loss of life. Imagine nine out of 10 people, you know, simply disappearing. It's almost impossible to grasp. And this horrific decline brings us back to the conquistador motivations. These weren't men who came to the Americas to settle down, become farmers. Not at all. The Spanish were primarily an urban culture, Steeped in a society that valued social status, inherited privilege. These men sought immediate wealth. Gold, silver, any riches they could extract, with the explicit, almost singular goal of taking that wealth back to Spain. Back to Spain. Their ambition was to live like Hidalgo. Hidalgos? Yeah, a term for the lower nobility or gentry, literally sons of something. It implied a life of inherited wealth, privilege, leisure, free from manual labor, dependent on the services of others. They sought status, not toil. If we connect this to the bigger picture, then this powerful desire for quick wealth combined with the rapidly diminishing labor force due to disease, that created a desperate and utterly brutal system. Absolutely. The encomenderos, seeing their source of labor literally dying off before their eyes, resorted to brutally enforcing and exploiting the natives to gain as much wealth as they possibly could before the natives died. A race against time. A frantic, cruel race against time. Indigenous people were forced into grueling labor in mines, agriculture, construction, often without adequate food, rest, or protection from disease. The abuses included physical violence, starvation, sexual exploitation, the destruction of family units, all driven by this insatiable hunger for immediate riches before the resource vanished. This truly shows the direct, devastating impact of power structures and immediate economic incentives on human lives throughout history. It's a stark reminder of what happens when human beings are viewed purely as a means to an end. But not everyone in Spain agreed with this brutal exploitation. In fact, a powerful voice emerged from within the Spanish clergy, leading to a fascinating and deeply consequential historical moment. The Valladolid debate. Ah. Las Casas. Emerging from this brutal reality was a Spanish priest named Bartolome de Las Casas. He had actually been encomendero himself in the Caribbean in his youth, Right? He saw it firsthand. But a profound conversion experience led him to renounce his encomienda and become a fervent advocate for the indigenous, its populations. He observed the unfolding catastrophe firsthand, and it transformed him into a tireless champion for native rights. He fundamentally believed, based on Christian theology and natural law, that natives were rational human beings possessing souls and reason, who deserved the king's protection. Rational human beings? Yeah. Not in his view, chattel to be worked to death simply for the enrichment of conquistadoris. He was very vocal about this, wasn't he? Wrote a famous book. Incredibly vocal, even audacious. He penned a short account of the destruction of the Indies, A powerful and influential book, vividly detailing the atrocities committed by the Spanish colonists. The Destruction of the Indies. It's written with a passionate polemical style, often cited as a foundational text for what became known as the Black Legend. The Black Legend? Yeah. The idea that the Spanish were uniquely cruel. Exactly. A narrative depicting Spanish colonization as particularly brutal and exploitative often highlighted more than the actions of other European powers. Now, much of what Las Casas described was undeniably true about the brutality, of course, but it's important to acknowledge the Black Legend itself is debated by historians. Its origins, its use by rival powers, its overall impartiality. Okay, so Las Casa's argument to the king was what exactly? Twofold really? Firstly, a moral imperative. The exploitation was an offense against God and natural law. Secondly, a practical concern. The Indians were dying off at an alarming rate because of this horrific exploitation, which would ultimately undermine Spain's whole colonial enterprise. Right, but you mentioned earlier he wasn't entirely correct about the cause of death. That's right. It's worth noting. He believed it was solely the brutal exploitation and overwork killing them. While that was certainly a massive accelerant to their decline, modern historical understanding with epidemiological evidence, points to European diseases as the main initial culprit. But he was right about the exploitation being monstrous, absolutely correct about the injustice, and that it was a significant factor in their rapid disappearance. Okay, and who argued against him opposing Las Casas was Juan Genes de Sepulveda, a highly respected humanist, philosopher, theologian. He was actually King Charles V's official chronicler. So a serious intellectual opponent. Very much so. Sepulveda presented a chillingly rationalized counterargument. Drawing heavily on Aristotelian philosophy, he contended that natives were not fully human in the European sense, effectively placing them on a level below white Europeans within what he described as tiers of humanity. This concept, unfortunately common in some European thought, then linked perceived primitive status to cultural, even physical traits, with white Europeans at the top. Wow. For Sepulveda, the indigenous peoples were essentially natural slaves, meant to be ruled by those more civilized. And how did that justify the encomienda? Well, he argued that while natives might be less than fully human, they could be made to be human through education and civilization provided by white Europeans. Ah, the civilizing mission argument. Decisively, from his perspective, the forced labor of the encomienda wasn't just economic. It was the price for this education. It was framed as a favor to the indigenous people, a necessary step on their path to becoming civilized and, crucially, Christianized. So you had these two completely opposing arguments laid before the king, diametrically opposed, one rooted in radical Christian ethics, the other in classical philosophy and a more traditional view of conquest. And this led to the Valladolid debate. Exactly. This profound clash of ideologies culminated in the Valladolid debate held over several sessions between 1550 and 1551 in Valladolid city, Spain. What's so significant about this debate? What's truly extraordinary and frankly groundbreaking, is that this was arguably the first major debate in European history on the fundamental issue of human rights. A public royal inquiry into who has rights as humans and whether conquest could be justified based on the perceived inferiority of the conquered. The first Human rights debate. That's huge. It was a monumental intellectual and moral confrontation, setting a precedent for state sponsored ethical deliberation on colonization. And the outcome. Who did the king side with? The king, after hearing both sides, eventually sided with Las Casas. He decreed that Indians were indeed human, rational human beings and deserved his royal protection with souls capable of salvation. A victory for Las Casas, then? In many ways, yes. A significant victory for human rights. A landmark moment in Western legal and ethical thought. The king subsequently issued the New Laws of the Indies in 1542, actually preceding the main debate, but solidified by its conclusions. The new laws of 1542, what did they do? They were designed to reform colonial administration, outlawing the encomienda system, or at least severely curtailing it, by forbidding inheritance of encomiendas. They also aimed to separate natives into a group under the direct protection of the king, not the arbitrary authority of encomenderos. This meant they couldn't be arbitrarily exploited for forced labor, and their lands were supposed to be respected. Okay, so a victory for human rights protection for the natives. But you mentioned earlier, this had tragic consequences. This raises an important question, doesn't it? If it was a victory, why does it feel like such a heavy, tragic turning point? Because while it was a triumph for the indigenous peoples of the Americas, in one crucial sense, it had a profound and utterly tragic unintended consequence. Unintended consequence. Okay. The Spanish Crown still desperately needed labor for its colonial enterpr. The silver mines in Peru and Mexico, the sugar plantations in the Caribbean. Incredibly profitable ventures. Right. The labor need to disappear. Exactly. If they couldn't exploit native labor to the same extent, and that labor force was rapidly dwindling anyway due to disease, where would they get it? Oh, no. Africa. And the answer, tragically and devastatingly, was Africa. This decision, driven by economic necessity and the new legal and moral restrictions on indigenous labor, directly prompted the massive escalation of the transatlantic slave trade. Escalation? Not the beginning, but a huge increase. A massive increase. Over the next centuries, as many as 15 million slaves were forcibly transported from Africa, across the Atlantic to the Americas. To fill that labor void, a forced migration and enslavement on an unimaginable scale. 15 million. So if we connect this to the bigger picture, a seemingly well intentioned policy, a victory for human rights for one group, the indigenous populations of the Americas unleashed a catastrophe of unprecedented scale and suffering for another, the peoples of Africa. Wow. This was a tragedy on the scale of the Holocaust. Or even worse, arguably, in terms of sheer Human lives destroyed, cultures shattered, suffering inflicted across continents and generations. It's a stark, powerful example of how historical decisions, even those with good intentions, can have unforeseen, devastating and far reaching ripple effects. Absolutely. Understanding this level of historical complexity and unintended consequences is vital to appreciating the true fabric of the past. It truly is an astonishing and profoundly tragic example. This complexity, this constant uncovering of unintended consequences, is why history is never as simple as it seems. And it brings us to a crucial how do we even begin to piece together these incredibly complex narratives, especially when the stakes are so high, the human elements so profound? Right? How do we make sense of it all? This is where understanding the very nature of historical sources and the process of history itself becomes paramount. Have you ever heard of historiography before? It sounds a bit academic. Maybe it does, but it's a concept that truly changes how you engage with historical knowledge. Historiography is essentially the practice of doing history, or maybe more specifically, the study of historical writing itself. The study of historical writing. Okay, when we talk about history, not just what happened, but the way we remember and interpret what happened, we. We're talking about something that is produced, curated, recorded. It's not static, not carved in stone. And that production is incredibly dynamic, constantly evolving. Think about something like Columbus Day versus Indigenous Peoples Day. Good example. For decades, Columbus Day was celebrated, often framed as a celebration of America's founding discovery, ethnic pride for some. But today, in many places, that narrative has shifted dramatically towards Indigenous Peoples Day, recognizing the immense suffering, displacement, genocide brought by European arrival. It's not just a name change, is it? No, it reflects a deep cultural shift, a re evaluation of values, a recontextualization of events. What's truly fascinating here is how that change manifests in historical accounts. If you read a history book about Columbus written in, say, 1900, then compare it to one from 1950, then again to one from 2020, you'll find your fundamentally different stories even using the same core documents. Often, yes. The historical narrative evolves as society changes, as culture shifts, as new information emerges like archaeological findings, and as different perspectives gain prominence. The historian's process involves not just looking at original documents, but rigorously examining how the narrative has been constructed, debated, challenged, altered over time. It's about seeing the evolution of understanding itself, which is crucial for forming a truly fresh and nuanced perspective. Absolutely. That leads us to another powerful concept. Ontology, or what is ontological? Sounds philosophical. It is, but for our purposes, think of it as an implicit organization of the world and its inhabitants. It's what's so deeply embedded in our culture, our knowledge that we know things to be true without even realizing we know them. It's fundamental, often subconscious, shaping our worldview. Like things we just assume. Kind of think about social media. A decade ago, many of us implicitly knew it was mainly for fun, connecting with friends. Now our collective ontology has shifted. We often implicitly know it influences elections, mental health, geopolitics. That fundamental shift in what we inherently know is an ontological change. Okay, I think I get it. Is there a historical example? A really powerful one comes from Michel Rolph Trouillot's fantastic book, Silencing the Power and the Production of History. Silencing the Past. He tells the story of Monsieur Le Barre, a French slave owner on Saint Domingue, modern Haiti, just before the Haitian Revolution in 1791. Okay. Le Barre wrote a letter home to his wife in France assuring her they were perfectly safe from slave revolt. He confidently stated that the slaves can't even imagine liberty in the way white people could, because their very nature precluded it. He wrote that can't even imagine liberty as a fact. He wasn't speculating, he was stating it as a deeply held, self evident truth. But of course, his knowledge was profoundly, tragically wrong. Because the revolution happened. Exactly. Not long after writing that letter, Le Barre was killed by rebelling slaves on his own plantation during the opening stages of the Haitian Revolution, A revolution born precisely from the enslaved people's fierce desire for liberty. So his knowledge was false, but he believed it. Absolutely. It motivated the way he lived, how he ran his plantation. That's the crux of ontology. Lebar's worldview, his ontological outlook, was profoundly shaped by his position, his culture, the economic system, the prevailing ideologies justifying slavery. He literally couldn't conceive of slaves desiring freedom because his fundamental understanding of the world precluded it. And the connection for us, we too have an ontological outlook. We inherently know slavery is wrong, that all humans deserve fundamental rights. Nobody has to explicitly teach us that. It's deeply embedded in our modern culture, part of our collective known truths. Right. And because our modern outlook is so radically different from lebar's, it's incredibly challenging to truly understand his perspective without just dismissing him as evil or foolish. Exactly. But a historian's crucial, nuanced job is to try and look at the world through their eyes, understand their lived reality, their perceived truths, without abandoning our own modern moral judgments. That's a fine line to walk it requires acknowledging that people in different periods lived in ontologically different worlds, shaped by different assumptions. History demands a lot of nuance. It's not simply black and white facts. That's not math. Definitely not math. Think about analyzing a baseball game, the final score, say 3, 2. That's a fact, right? But the story of the game, how it felt, whether the referee was biased, how the teams performed, why one team won, that story will differ dramatically depending on which team's fan you ask. Right? Totally different narratives. That's history. It operates in that ambiguous interpretive space. If you just get dates and simple outcomes, you understand nothing about the richness, the contradictions, the complexity of human experience. That's a perfect analogy. And that leads us directly to two more crucial definitions from Troia, silencing the past that underpin this historicity 1 and historicity 2. Historicity 1 is simply what happened. The actual events, the raw data, just the facts, like the baseball score. Historicity 2 is what is said to have happened, the interpretation, the narrative created, recorded, shared, remembered. The fan story of the game. Exactly. And any work of history you read is a product of the tension, the dialogue, sometimes the conflict between these two. It's the interplay between the actual occurrence and the way that occurrence is understood, presented and remembered across time and through different cultural lenses. It's why there can be so many different histories of the same event. Okay, and finally, just to really ground this, let's quickly clarify. Primary versus secondary sources. Common point of confusion, but fundamental. Absolutely key. A primary source is an uninterpreted document, Direct first hand accounts, artifacts, original records from the period. So for the conquest accounts written by the soldier Bernal Diaz, or the native authored Florentine Codex, those are primary sources produced by people who experienced or were very close to the events. Right. In contrast, a secondary source is an interpretation of a primary source. So your history textbook, a documentary, an academic article, even an introduction written by a modern historian to an old primary document, those are secondary sources. Analyses, syntheses, narratives constructed from primary sources, rather than being the raw material themselves. Understanding this distinction is fundamental to critically evaluating any historical information. It forces you to ask, whose interpretation? What sources are they using? What's their bias? This section, I think, provides a truly powerful framework for evaluating any information, really helping you see the layers behind simple facts and understand why different accounts exist. Now, let's apply these concepts, historiography, ontology, source types, directly to the actual accounts of the Mexican conquest. This is where it gets really interesting, applying the theory. Because as you'll see, none of the sources are as straightforward or objective as you might initially hope. Let's start with the accounts written by the conquistadores themselves. One major early one is Francisco Lopez de Gomaras. Historia General de las Indias, published 1552. He was Hernan Cortes secretary. Sounds promising, right? Direct access? You'd think so, but here's the Gumar never actually went to the Americas, never set foot there. His entire account was based on Cortez's letters, official reports, personal recollections. So given that, how do you think his history would portray Cortes? Well, it would be entirely, almost uncritically supportive of Cortez, naturally. It was essentially a glorified biography, a defense of his patrons actions and claims to glory. So valuable for understanding Cortes's self perception exactly how he wanted to be seen. By the Crown, by history. The official narrative he wished to project, but far from impartial, filtered through a very specific, deeply biased lens. Elevating Cortez, justifying his rebellion against Velazquez. Okay, then, in direct contrast, you have Bernal Diaz del Castillo. He wrote La Verdadera Historia de la Conquista de Nueva Espana. Boldly translated as the true story of the conquest of New Spain. The true story. Quite a title, right? Diaz was a common soldier, a foot soldier who was there, participated in nearly every major campaign, every battle. An eyewitness. He explicitly stated he wrote his account in direct response to Gomara's history. Diaz and his fellow common soldiers felt Gomara didn't give enough credit to the other men who actually did the fighting, attributing all glory just to Cortez. Okay, so a corrective from the trenches perspective, but there are complexities there too, right? Definitely. What's truly fascinating, and adds another layer, is that Diaz wrote his lengthy detailed history when he was in his 70s, decades later, many decades after the actual events. His memory, while remarkably sharp for some details, would naturally be selective, colored by time stories shared among comrades, his own evolving perspective. And wasn't he an encomendero himself? Crucially, yes. At the time he was writing, the encomienda system was under increasing scrutiny. Threat from the king. Influenced by Las Casas, Diaz desperately wanted to keep his grant ensure his and his descendants livelihood. Ah, so his entire account, while incredibly rich in detail and personal experience, is undeniably shaped by that significant bias he's justifying. His actions, those of his fellow conquistadores and the system he benefited from. So, eyewitness, yes, but still a carefully constructed defense influenced by personal interests. And the political climate of his later years. Okay, so Gamarra is pro Cortes, Diaz is pro common soldier and pro encomienda. Then we have the accounts of the clergy, most notably Bartolome de las Casas, whom we discussed. His short account of the destruction of the Indies, published 1552. A powerful, albeit polemical, primary source from a clerical perspective. His viewpoint, as we know, vehemently critical of Spanish abuses, emphasizing the moral and theological dimensions. An invaluable counter narrative to the conquistador accounts. Absolutely. A different lens entirely. And finally, we have the accounts of the natives themselves, primarily found in the monumental Florentine Codex. Ah, the codex. An incredible resource. An ethnographic masterpiece, really. Compiled mid 16th century under the direction of the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagun, Written by native scholars, specifically those educated by the church at the Collegio de Santa Cruz de Tlateloco. Produced under church auspices, documenting history, culture, religion, the natural world in Nahuatl, mostly with Spanish translations, illustrations. Amazing. But calling it the Aztec account or a singular pure native perspective would be misleading, wouldn't it? It would. These writers, while indigenous, were children of the nobility. They weren't present during the conquest itself. More significantly, they were educated by the Spanish Christians. Their worldview was inevitably shaped by Spanish intellectual frameworks, Christian theology, even as they sought to preserve their own heritage. And critically, they weren't all Mexica. That's a crucial distinction. While they wrote about the Mexica, many of the primary informants and writers for the codex were Tlaxcalans or came from other allied city states. Not the Mexica, the actual people of Tenochtitlan who were conquering Klax. Callens, writing about the Mexican conquest. Yeah, it's like trying to understand the full American perspective on an event by only interviewing people from California or only Texas. Both American, but different viewpoints, experiences, political leanings. Right. The Tlaxcalans were a distinct group. Own history, own grievances, own agenda, often at odds with the Mexica. So while the Florentine Codex gives us an absolutely invaluable indigenous voice, it's not a pure, untainted Mexican perspective. It's complex, shaped by external Spanish influences and internal indigenous divisions. A testament to native cultures adapting. So here's the fundamental challenge for historians and for you listening. As you can see, none of these sources are really very trustworthy in the way we might think of a perfectly objective, unbiased record. They all come with significant baggage, personal agendas, ontological frameworks. Yeah, none are pure. So how can we possibly use them to construct something that even approaches a true narrative? How do we build a coherent, reliable understanding from such inherently biased fragments? This raises a profoundly important question for the practice of history. The method historians use is painstaking cross referencing and corroboration. We look for statements supported by others. If multiple, diverse sources, ideally with different biases, corroborated detail, it's more likely to have actually happened, kind of. But we must always acknowledge and critically analyze the biases in each force. Who wrote this, why? For whom? What did they gain or lose? And as we discussed with ontology, our own current ontological outlook, our ingrained beliefs, values like rooting for the underdog, favoring certain political narratives, will inevitably influence how we interpret these sources. We bring our own biases too? Absolutely. It's a constant act of critical self awareness, a demanding dance between empathy for the past and modern moral judgment. It's about building a comprehensive, nuanced understanding, not expecting a single simplistic truth. A fantastic, almost archetypal example of this challenge, and how historical narratives can be shaped, even invented, to serve present needs, is the story of the return of Quethal Coatl. Have you heard this one? Oh, yes. The feathered serpent returns. The popular story, often cited even in textbooks, goes something like, in ancient times, a city was ruled by Tapiltsin, an incarnation of the Nahuatl God Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent. He was exiled, vowed to return from the east in a specific year, Si a cattle or one reed in the Mexican calendar. When Cortes arrived in Mexico in 1519, that was indeed a sea Acatl year, so the story goes. Many natives, including Emperor Montezuma, believed he was either Quetzalcoatlimps or. Or his representative, which explains their initial welcoming posture. And the Florentine Codex seems to support this. Right, with that passage where Montezuma supposedly welcomes Cortes, saying, you have come, my lord. We have been waiting for you. Exactly. Seems to confirm it. However, if you turn to Bernal Diaz's account, primary source, Spanish participant, there is absolutely no mention of this divine recognition, no mention of Montezuma thinking Cortez is a God. So, two key sources, dramatically different on a huge point. Who do you believe? Right. And here's the bombshell that many historians have revealed in recent decades. There's actually no solid evidence that this entire elaborate story of To Pilsen and the prophesied return of Quetzalcoatlite in Sayacatl predates the conquest itself. Ah, so it might have been created after many historians now Strongly believe that narrative was in fact invented after. After the conquest. And what's even more fascinating, it was likely invented primarily by the natives, not by the Spanish. Invented by the natives. Wow. That's a classic example of historicity 2 shaping historicity 1, isn't it? Exactly. Why would they do that? Why invent such a powerful story after the fact? Well, if we connect this to the bigger picture, it served as a profound, psychologically satisfying explanation for the unimaginable collapse of their vast, powerful empire. How could they, the proud Mexica, have been defeated by a few hundred foreigners? It needed an explanation. The Quetzalcoatl myth offered one. Oh, we just thought he was the God and he wasn't the God. We got tricked by destiny or a divine misunderstanding. It shifts the blame. Precisely. It shifts the guilt or the incomprehensible failure away from Native actions, leadership, internal weaknesses onto destiny, divine deception, cosmological misinterpretation. It transforms a devastating military and political defeat into something understandable within their spiritual framework. So more of a coping mechanism. It's far more of a nation building story, or a coping mechanism to explain a cataclysmic event rather than an accurate historical account of initial Indigenous beliefs. When Cortez arrived. That's an aha moment right there for so many of us. Yeah. It demonstrates how history can be not just written, but sometimes rewritten or shaped to serve. Present narratives explain the inexplicable forge identity, just like how different political factions today might portray. Events like the Tea Party movement as universally just and principled may be overlooking complexities. This Quetzalcoatl story helped post conquest Indigenous societies come to terms with an overwhelming defeat. Realizing these layers of interpretation, purpose, even invention behind seemingly factual historical accounts is truly empowering. It equips you to be a much more discerning, critical consumer of any historical narrative. And really, any information you encounter. It's crucial. So what does all of this mean for you as a learner, as someone navigating the vast sea of information in today's world? Well, we've taken a deep dive into the profound complexity of historical events. The Spanish conquest, the devastating exploitation through systems like the encomienda. But more critically, we've explored how our understanding of the past is always shaped by the sources available, the inherent biases, those who created them, and even our own perspectives and deeply ingrained beliefs, our ontological outlook that we often don't even realize we possess. Yes, indeed, history isn't just a collection of inert, objective facts to memorize. It's a dynamic, ongoing conversation about what happened and what is said to have happened. It's a conversation. It's a constant process of interpretation, reevaluation, understanding the human element embedded in every record. As you move forward, maybe consider how your own ontological outlook, your own set of implicit truths and deeply held beliefs might be shaping your understanding of today's events, just as it shaped how historical events were recorded and interpreted in the past. What assumptions do you hold that might be influencing your perception of the world around you right now? That's a powerful thought to mull over, isn't it? To consider the lenses through which we view our own present. We hope this deep dive has encouraged your continued curiosity, not just about what happened in history, but about the profound why and how of historical narratives. Keep asking those questions, because understanding the nature of sources, the biases within them, and the dynamic human element behind every recorded event is a truly powerful tool for navigating information in any field in any time, empowering you to be more critical and informed thinker. Thanks for joining us for this deep dive.

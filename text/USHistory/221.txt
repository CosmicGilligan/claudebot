In this module, we will examine the Progressive Movement, a period of reform that emerged in the United States as a response to the problems created by the Industrial Revolution. Previously, we discussed the Gilded Age, exploring how a thin veneer of prosperity disguised deep rooted societal issues. Now we how do industrializing nations respond to these challenges? And how did the United States response differ? Before getting into the details of Progressivism, let's recap key Industrial Revolution concepts. Firstly, there was a shift in the basis of wealth. Previously, land equaled wealth, but industrialization shifted the basis to capital or money invested in production. This meant more people could become wealthy, stimulating democratic expansion. Secondly, remember the Golden Rule, whoever has the gold makes the rules. Increased wealth led to increased political power, but it also opened the door to corruption, undermining the very heart of democracy. Additionally, the Industrial Revolution led to the rise of a new middle class. This group, as we'll see, would spearhead the Progressive movement for reform. Finally, the period was marked by the exploitation of workers and staggering wealth inequality, consequences the Progressives sought to address. The United States developed a unique response to the Industrial Revolution, the Progressive Era, roughly 1890s to 1920s. Key characteristics of progressivism include being primarily middle class driven, with figures like doctors, lawyers, and journalists championing it. Progressives sought social change while maintaining capitalism, believing in progress through intervention, the idea that government and social action could improve society. Inspired by scientific and industrial progress, they emphasized efficiency in government and the economy. Though united by a belief in reform, progressives had diverse goals, including limiting corporate power, improving worker conditions, political reforms like women's suffrage, and various social justice initiatives. The Progressive Era achieved significant reforms. Examples include antitrust legislation designed to reduce the power of monopolies and promote competition within the marketplace. Labor reforms focused on improving worker conditions, such as child labor laws and workplace safety regulations. Politically, progressives supported initiatives and referendums that gave citizens more direct input, the direct election of senators, and the landmark achievement of women gaining the right to vote. Additionally, the Progressive Era marked a shift toward a nascent awareness of environmental issues with the start of conservation movements. The Progressive Era, born of the struggles of the Industrial Revolution, reshaped the relationship between the US Government and its citizens, leading to increased government influence and addressing, imperfectly, of course, some of the period's excesses.

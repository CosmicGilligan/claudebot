In this segment, we are going to look at political parties, primarily the two dominant parties, Republicans and Democrats. We will consider the factions within the parties during the late 19th century. We will also explore the shift in focus of the two parties over time and consider briefly some third parties that arose during this period. The Republican Party at this time was divided into two main factions called the Stalwarts and the Mugwumps. The Stalwarts adhered stringently to party orthodoxy, resisting changes to the established platform. In contrast, the Mugwumps were characterized by their willingness to engage in compromise and often held more moderate views. The etymology of Mugwump is rooted in a Native American language symbolizing a person whose allegiances are split, illustrated by the colloquialism of having one's mug on one side of the fence and one wump on the other. In the Democratic Party, there was a geographical schism between Northern and Southern Democrats. The Southern Democrats maintained ideologies that supported white supremacy, continuing the pre Civil War power structures. Conversely, Democrats in other regions evolved to represent the interests of immigrants, farmers, and industrial workers. In addition to these primary factions, various third parties have played pivotal roles during eras marked by social unrest. These include the Prohibition Party, advocating for the cessation of alcohol consumption, the Greenback Party, favoring an increase in currency circulation, and the Populist Party, championing the causes of agrarian interests and the broader populace. We need to address some misinformation common among certain politically motivated groups that links contemporary Republicans and Democrats with the parties of the 1860s. Before the Civil War, there were two main parties, the Democrats and the Whigs. However, both parties were internally divided between their northern and Southern factions. The Whig Party eventually disintegrated, primarily because its unifying cause was opposition to Andrew Jackson. By the 1850s, with Jackson deceased, there was little to keep the whigs united. In 1854, a new party was formed, known as the Republican Party or the GOP Grand Old Party of Jefferson. This party attracted Northern Whigs, New York Free Soilers and other groups, inheriting the Northeastern Federalists politics that favored commerce and big business, as well as the Free Soilers stance on restricting slavery's expansion. Thus, the Republican Party emerged as economically aligned with big business interests while being socially liberal, particularly in its opposition to slavery, which was a radical stance at the time. On the other hand, the Democratic Party, founded as Andrew Jackson's party, positioned itself as the people's party, adopting a socially conservative and populist stance. During the Civil War, the Republicans were seen as the party of big business and social liberalism, while the Democrats represented the people but maintained socially conservative views. In the election of 1860, the Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln did not appear on the ballot in Southern states. The fact that he won the election without the south was a major factor convincing Southerners to secede. But the south had been contemplating secession for decades, primarily over the issue of slavery and matters related to the institution of slavery. Since the majority party in the south was Democratic and Democrats eventually regained control after the war, it is reasonable to conclude that a significant segment of the Democratic Party held white supremacist views. But it is misleading to conclude then that the Democratic Party was white supremacist, the party of the KK because in the north and west the Democratic Party represented labor, immigrants and farmers. During the period we are discussing, a new party, the Populist Party was formed. At first representing the interests of farmers. This party was eventually absorbed into the Progressive Party, a reform oriented group we will discuss in the next module. The Progressive Party was once championed by the Republican Party under Theodore Roosevelt, but the party jettisoned its socially progressive wing in the 1900s and those policies were eventually absorbed by the Democratic Party, leading to a shift in the political landscape. By the election of 1912, the Republicans remained the party of big business but became more socially conservative, abandoning progressive ideals. Meanwhile, under Woodrow Wilson, the Democrats evolved into the socially liberal party while remaining the party of the people. This historical overview highlights the erroneous nature of arguments that claim the Republican Party is inherently the party of civil rights and the Democratic Party the party of racists based on their 19th century stance on slavery and race. Such arguments overlook the significant shifts in party ideologies and alignments over time. Notably, the Democratic Party's association with white supremacy persisted post Civil War, particularly in the South. However, as the Democratic Party embraced progressive and civil rights causes in the 20th century, it alienated Southern Democrats who had maintained white supremacist ideologies. The realignment became evident in the 1940s and continued with the Southern Strategy of the 1960s, where disaffected Southern Democrats shifted shifted to the Republican Party, attracted by appeals to their segregationist and conservative values. This historical evolution demonstrates the complex and dynamic nature of political party identities and ideologies, underscoring the importance of understanding these changes rather than adhering to outdated or simplified or even fabricated narratives of party history. In the next segment, we will consider the political party system during this era and how each party proposed to address these issues.

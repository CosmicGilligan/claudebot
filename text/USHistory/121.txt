In this module, we're going to look at the transition from feudal agrarian economies that characterized Western Europe in the Middle Ages to the industrial capitalism that propelled the west, including the United States, to world domination. We will begin by considering the Industrial Revolution in a theoretical way. Your discussion topic will include a video that demonstrates some of the effects of the Industrial Revolution on real people. We're going to start way back in time in the Middle Ages by considering the land tenure system known as feudalism. This system was structured around a unit of land called a fief within a kingdom. Although all land was technically owned by the king, it was allocated to lords, his trusted allies. The social order of the Middle Ages was vividly reflected in the layout of a fief. Each fief typically included a village, fields belonging to the lord, often referred to as the fields of the lord, and common lands. The common lands, or commons, were used by the peasants to grow crops and rear livestock. In this system, lords did not own the land or the peasants, but had rights to the peasants. Labor in exchange for protection and the use of commons, peasants owed labor to the lord. This labor initially involved working in the lord's fields, producing agricultural goods that the lord would then sell for profit. However, as time progressed, the lords realized that greater profits could be made by allowing peasants to earn money independently. Consequently, the nature of peasants dues shifted from labor to monetary rent, laying the foundation for the modern concept of rent paid to a landlord. This feudal system was predominantly agrarian, with the wealth and power of a lord being directly tied to land ownership. Despite its agrarian nature, the system operated on a subsistence level, meaning that production was generally only enough to meet the immediate needs of the community. For everyone but the lords, there was no surplus, nothing left over to trade or accumulate wealth. Everyone in the village contributed to producing enough for all to live. While agriculture was the backbone of the economy, there was always a need to manufacture things. Industries necessary for producing heavy equipment like cannons were located in the hills to harness water power. Everyday items like horseshoes, pots, pans, hats, and shoes were produced within the village and cottages. A prime example of this cottage industry was the production of textiles, which played a significant role in the emergence of the Brit. The process was personalized and localized. For instance, a villager needing a sweater would commission a local craftsman who owned a loom. This cottage industry was characterized by small scale production of high quality goods at reasonable prices, with each craftsman producing one item at a time tailored to the individual's needs. The concept of profit in this system was closely linked to ownership of the means of production, such as a loom. In the case of textile production, the craftsmen would buy raw materials like wool, use their skills and equipment to create a product like a sweater, and the profit or surplus from the sale after deducting costs was their reward for owning and operating the means of production.

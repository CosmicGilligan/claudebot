In this segment we are going to discuss two modernization and the agricultural Revolution and the impact these aspects of industrialization have had on modern society. You are likely familiar with the term modernization, but its implications may differ from what you may previously have thought. Modernization, for our purposes is defined as to look like the west, characterized by an industrialized economy and a liberal government. Recall our earlier discussion on the meaning of liberty. It encompasses three key democracy, which entails popular sovereignty, and the principle of one person, one vote secularism, which relates to the separation of religion from governmental affairs and laissez faire capitalism, the economic system allowing for free market operations. Together, these form the foundation of classical liberalism. A modernized country is one with an industrial economy and a liberal government. In this case, the term liberal contrasts with other political types such as monarchy, theocracy or autocracy, or other economic systems such as communism. There were cases, such as in Russia, where countries possessed industrial economies without liberal governments, but state controlled industrialization was not as successful. The exception to this would be Japan. Consider the countries that could be classified as modernized around 1850 with industrial economies and liberal governments. Predominantly, these were in Western Europe, Britain, France, parts of what is today Germany and Belgium, but notably not Spain, Italy, or Russia. The United States joined this group in the latter half of the 19th century after the Civil War. In summary, let's remember that modernization means to look like the west in our context. Moving on to the agricultural Revolution, let's discuss the historical shift stemming from the discovery of America. This event granted Europeans access to new crops, enabling fewer people to produce sufficient food for larger populations. During the Middle Ages, Europe's population remained relatively stagnant, with occasional growth offset by famines or plagues. The introduction of the potato, a seemingly unremarkable crop, revolutionized European agriculture, leading to sustained population growth from that point until after World War II. Also accompanying technological advances in production and transportation, new technologies were developed to increase agricultural output. This agricultural shift disrupted the traditional agrarian economy, as less labor was required for food production. Many who previously worked in agriculture became surplus. This phenomenon is illustrated in Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol where Scrooge refers to the surplus population, people available for work exceeding the available jobs. This surplus labor allowed factory owners to maintain low wages as workers were easily replaceable. Consequently, displaced rural workers migrated to cities in search of employment, often in factories. For example, individuals might move from rural England to industrial cities like Manchester, only to find scarce employment opportunities due to the high number of workers. Many then sought opportunities abroad, emigrating to the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and other parts of the Americas, marking a significant population movement. Throughout the 19th century, cities like London, New York and Boston experienced unprecedented growth, a process known as urbanization. The focus of the Western industrialized world shifted from rural villages to urban centers. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on Canvas.

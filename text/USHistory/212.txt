In the last segment, we said that the issues facing the national government during the Gilded Age were not as consequential as those before the Civil War, but there were still issues that dominated national politics. In this section, we're going to consider patronage, money, and the tariff. We will consider the terms of the debates about these issues, and then in the next segment we will talk about the different political parties and their proposed solutions. Patronage refers to the exchange of political favors for political support. In simple terms, political favors refers to jobs and support refers to votes. In other words, in exchange for votes, political candidates promise government jobs or control of those jobs. An example of this can be seen in the 2008 Democratic primary, where then candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were vying for the nomination. Upon the realization that Obama was poised for victory, an agreement was brokered wherein Clinton would endorse Obama and rally her supporters behind him in exchange for her subsequent appointment as Secretary of State. This transaction exemplifies the essence of patronage. Historically, patronage has existed at all levels of American politics, originating from the organization of new voters into cohesive voting blocs during the Jacksonian era. To illustrate this point further, consider the portrayal of law enforcement officers in classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, who are often depicted with Irish accents. This creative choice reflects a historical reality where Irish immigrants, having settled in ethnic enclaves within American cities such as Boston or New York, sought employment through local hiring halls controlled by political bosses. These bosses, wielding considerable influence over government jobs, could effectively organize the electorate in their districts to secure positions such as police commissioners. Consequently, Irish immigrants frequently found employment in law enforcement with the implicit expectation that they would mobilize voter turnout on election day to maintain the political status quo. However, this system is not without its drawbacks, primarily the inherent potential for corruption, including bribery. Such practices raise questions about the integrity of American politics and whether it operates on principles of meritocracy or is undermined by financial and political incentives. The dilemma of the Gilded Age was whether to preserve a system riddled with potential corruption or to pursue civil service reform. The latter would entail a transition from a patronage based system to one where government positions are awarded based on qualifications and expertise, thereby fostering governmental stability and reducing the influence of corrupt practices. It might seem obvious that civil service reform would be a sensible solution, but the reality was that those who had the power to change the patronage system benefited from it. Another pressing issue was the monetary policy of the United States, particularly its adherence to the gold standard. The gold standard is a monetary system where every paper dollar in your pocket is backed by an actual piece of gold in the treasury. This was not merely an American innovation, but a global standard led by the British. The United States, keen on matching Britain's economic prowess, embraced this system. Before the Civil War, it was a matter of international economic competition ensuring American currency held its own on the world stage. As the clouds of the Civil War gathered, this gold backed promise faced a challenge. The war demanded resources, uniforms, weapons and more, far beyond what the existing money supply could support. The solution was to temporarily suspend the gold standard to print more money unbacked by gold, known as greenbacks. This act was a double edged sword. It financed the war, but at the cost of inflation. The more money printed, the less each dollar was worth in gold terms. With the war ended, the US faced a Should it return to the gold standard? The debate was fierce. On one hand, returning to gold promised stability and international competitiveness. On the other, it risked economic hardship for many, especially farmers. Consider the farmer who borrows money at the season start, hoping to repay it after harvest. Under a reinstated gold standard, their debt repayment could skyrocket, a potential ruin. Let's consider a hypothetical yet illuminating example. Imagine the United States at the war's end making a decision to revert every dollar of currency back to its equivalent in gold. Under the gold standard, each dollar is a reflection of a dollar's worth of gold. But here's the Due to inflation during the war, what was once $1 in gold now effectively requires $10 in paper currency to match. Imagine you're a farmer during the Civil war who borrows $100 under the assumption that its value in gold will remain constant when the war ends and the nation decides to return to the gold standard. Suddenly, to repay your init loan, you now need the equivalent of $1,000 in wartime currency. This isn't just a simple arithmetic problem. It's an economic conundrum with real world implications. Commercial interests lobbied for returning to the gold standard to increase their competitiveness in world trade. But farmers and their advocates counseled keeping the standard at soft money as a matter of survival. Finally, tariffs. Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. Their primary purpose was originally to provide income for the national treasury. They can also be used to make foreign products more expensive, thus giving a competitive edge to domestically produced goods. The United States, from its inception, had been characterized by its dual economy, the industrial north and the agrarian South. This dichotomy is at the heart of the tariff debate. The north, with its burgeoning industrial economy, favored high tariffs, sometimes called protective tariffs. These taxes on imports protected Northern manufacturers from foreign competition, particularly from more industrially advanced Britain. After the Revolutionary War, American manufacturers struggled to compete with British goods, which were superior in quality and cheaper due to Britain's earlier industrialization. By imposing tariffs, American goods became relatively cheaper, fostering domestic industry. For the Northern states, tariffs were beneficial. They allowed American industries to grow, shielding them from the competition and helping the United States to eventually surpass Britain as a leading industrial power. By the early 20th century, however, the tariff issue had a markedly different impact on the southern economy. The South's economy was primarily based on export agriculture, particularly cotton, which was sold internationally. High tariffs prompted foreign countries to retaliate with their own tariffs, diminishing the profits Southern planters could earn from their exports. Furthermore, because the south relied on imported manufactured goods, tariffs increased the cost of these goods, doubly disadvantaging the agrarian economy. This situation created significant economic strain and contributed to the growing sectional tensions between north and South. The differing economic interests led to an intense political debate over the appropriate level of tariffs. This debate was a matter of economic policy but was also deeply enmeshed with the political and social fabric of the nation, contributing to the causes of the Civil War. The North's push for higher tariffs, which protected its industrial interests, clashed with the South's economic dependency on free trade for its agricultural exports. After the Civil War, the United States embarked on a period of rapid industrialization. The northern states, benefiting from protective tariffs, experienced a boom in manufacturing. The south, however, still recovering from the devastation of the war, struggled to rebuild its economy. Manufacturing and commercial interests favored maintaining and even increasing tariffs in order to maintain their competitive edge. It was also argued that high tariffs protected manufacturing jobs. However, the south and the emerging west, with their economies heavily reliant on agriculture, opposed high tariffs. They argued that tariffs led to retaliatory measures from foreign governments, harming American exports like cotton, tobacco, and wheat. In the next segment, we will consider the political party system during this era and how each party proposed to address these issues.

## 💡 Big Question  
**How did the control of gold, salt, and human labor shape the power of West African empires—and how did global trade both enrich and ultimately undermine them?**

---

## 🌍 Setting the Stage: The Sahel and the "Ocean of Sand"  

West Africa’s medieval empires arose in the **Sahel**, a grassland zone just south of the vast Sahara Desert. Far from being isolated, these kingdoms were connected to the wider world by **caravan trade routes**—the "sea lanes" of the desert.  

> *"Think of the Sahara Desert not as a barrier but as an ocean—an ocean of sand. And just like maritime trade routes across actual oceans, there were established caravan routes across this 'sand ocean' that had been traveled for centuries."* —Professor Cosmic

## 🏛 The Three Great Empires  

### **1. Ghana (c. 1000–1300 CE)**  
- Controlled **gold mines** and taxed all gold moving through their territory.  
- Salt was equally valuable—**"white gold"**—needed for preserving food and sustaining life.  
- Slavery existed in various forms, with captives traded across the Sahara.  

> *"Whoever has the gold makes the rules! And Ghana had ALL the gold."*  

But Ghana also faced constant threats from **Berber nomads** —"the pirates of the desert"—and religious pressure from the **Almoravids**.

---

### **2. Mali (c. 1230–1600 CE)**  
Rose after Ghana’s fall, controlling **Timbuktu, Gao, and Jenne**—key trade cities along the Niger River.  

Mansa Musa’s pilgrimage to Mecca (1324–1325) remains legendary:  
> *"At every town he stopped at between Mali and Mecca he handed out extravagant amounts of gold... so much that he actually destabilized the economy of Cairo."*

The **Catalan Atlas (1375)** even depicted him as a golden monarch, proof that his fame reached Europe.

<h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">📈 Data Analysis: Gold and Power</h4>
<ul style="color: #e8e8e8;">
<li><strong>Before:</strong> Local gold trade served small-scale economies.</li>
<li><strong>After:</strong> Mali centralized control of gold and taxed its movement.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Created unprecedented wealth and funded cultural and educational growth.</li>
</ul>

### **3. Songhai (c. 1464–1591 CE)**  
The largest of the three empires, expanding beyond Mali’s borders under **Sunni Ali**.  

> *"By the time we get to 1500... we have this sophisticated, wealthy, and powerful empire in West Africa that's contemporary with early Renaissance Europe."*

But Portuguese maritime routes began bypassing the desert, cutting into Songhai’s wealth. The empire fell to Morocco’s **small gunpowder army** —a stark reminder that **European weapons technology** would soon reshape global power.

## 🔄 Slavery: From Local Practice to Global Industry  

Historically, slavery in Africa was not race-based; captives came from warfare or punishment. But Portuguese maritime expansion turned slavery into a **massive transatlantic system**, driving wars specifically to capture slaves.

> *"We go from warfare causing slavery to slavery causing warfare."*

<h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">🚢 The Triangular Trade</h4>
<ul style="color: #fff;">
<li>Europe → Africa: Guns and manufactured goods.</li>
<li>Africa → Americas: Enslaved laborers.</li>
<li>Americas → Europe: Sugar, molasses, precious metals.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #fff; margin: 0;">This cycle fueled both African warfare and European economic dominance.</p>
</div>

## 🌐 Contemporary Connections  
- **Resource control** (gold, salt) parallels today’s strategic commodities like oil, rare earth minerals, and data.  
- **Weaponized trade**—guns for slaves—mirrors modern cycles where arms sales fuel instability.  
- **Cultural erasure** through exploitation connects to current debates on reparations and historical memory.

In this segment, we are going to begin considering some of the vast cultural changes that occur as the result of the application of the steam engine to manufacturing. We have observed a fundamental shift from the feudal system characterized by lords and peasants, to a new social order dominated by merchants. These merchants, emerging from urban centers are referred to as the bourgeoisie. This term reflects their city based origins. In French, the word for town is bourge. And that same word is used in English in titles, burgers and place names. Pittsburgh. The invention of the steam engine made it possible for manufacturing to move from peasant cottages in the villages to factories in the cities. In the cottage industry, one person was required to use one tool to produce one item. In this new manufacturing system, a machine can operate many tools to produce many items with only one person operating the machine. Because it is a machine, it can operate 24 hours a day. The focus shifts to producing a large quantity of goods of medium quality at low prices. The factory system's emphasis on standardization, exemplified by standardized clothing sizes like small, medium large and extra large, highlights the change towards mass production. The availability of labor and the low wages paid to workers contribute to the reduced cost of these goods. Another significant result of this movement was that the location of factories in cities caused the massive increase in size of the cities. Urbanization we will more fully consider the effects of the agricultural revolution in a later segment. At this point, we will just note that the introduction of new crops from the Americas and advances in agricultural methods made it possible for less people to grow more food. One consequence of this was the development of what I will call a surplus population. Whereas before, the efforts of everyone were needed for subsistence, now there are more people and less essential tasks for them to do. These individuals, migrating from villages and fiefdoms, sought employment in urban factories. However, upon entering the factory environment, they possessed nothing but their labor. Unlike peasants who owned their tools, the means of production, these workers, or what we will call the proletariat, a newly emerged class, have no such ownership. In the context of industrial capitalism, the bourgeoisie owns the factories, thereby controlling the means of production. This ownership allows them to acquire the surplus generated from production. In contrast, the proletariat, owning only their labor, receives merely a subsistence wage. This wage is barely sufficient for survival, ensuring that if a worker does not work, they do not earn even the basic necessities of life. The stark reality of this system is its inherently exploitative nature. The process of proletarianization involves a shift in the ownership of the means of production to the bourgeoisie, who then reap the benefits of surplus production. Concurrently, the proletariat, primarily originating from rural areas, are left with only their labor to offer, receiving a mere subsistence wage in return. This dynamic results in the formation of two distinct the well off bourgeoisie and the working poor. The proletariat. As you will see in the video I assigned for your discussion topic, this imbalance will eventually lead to social upheaval not just in Europe, but in every capitalist country, including the United States.

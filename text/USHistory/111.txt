This course is the second half of the US History Survey, beginning after the Civil War and potentially extending into the 21st century. To lay a foundation for our study, we'll briefly touch on the historical events and ideas that took place in the United States before the Civil War. This will give us some context as we begin the narrative. The United States has always been a nation of diverse socio cultural entities, a characteristic traceable to its earliest days. Economic divisions have been a significant factor in this diversity since the colonial period. For instance, Jamestown's establishment led to a plantation economy in the south reliant on slave labor. In contrast, New England, due to its unsuitability for plantation agriculture, developed a more mercantile society. These differing economies reflect broader historical patterns. The South's plantation economy mirrored Europe's feudal systems, albeit powered by slave labor instead of peasants. The north, mirroring England, moved towards industrialization and modernization, especially evident in the early stages of the Industrial Revolution. At its founding, the United States was essentially a union of different countries, a nation of nations. Before the Civil War and for some time after, people mostly identified more with their state than the nation. Before the Civil War, it was common to think of one's state as one's country, illustrated by the use of the phrase the United States are. After the Civil War it was. The United States is, as we say today. The Civil War caused a shift in national identity that would grow over time. The Constitutional Convention highlighted the debate over state versus federal supremacy, leading to the establishment of a federal system. This system delineated roles for both state and national governments, with the national government handling what individual states couldn't and states retaining all other powers. Political parties were not part of the system the Founders codified in the Constitution, but came about because of what would become permanently a part of American life. Widely differing ideas about the fundamental nature of the United States. Washington's cabinet included Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State and Alexander Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury. These men had very different visions of what the country ought to be, and their vociferous mutual opposition resulted in the first party system. Hamilton's followers, the Federalists, favored a strong central government and were primarily loose constructionists, interpreting the Constitution as a flexible guideline. Their economic focus was on commerce and industry, with Britain as a key ally. On the other hand, Jefferson's followers, the Democratic Republicans, advocated for state supremacy and strict adherence to the Constitution. They championed agriculture. Jefferson imagined a republic based on independent family farmers rather than a geography for plantation agriculture. The unavoidable stain on American history is the institution of slavery. While slavery was globally prevalent, its role in the US Became particularly significant, deeply intertwined with the South's economy and subsequently embedded in the Constitution through the Three Fifths clause. The Constitution also outlawed the external slave trade in 1807. At the time the Constitution was written, it was thought that ending the slave trade would bring about the gradual end of slavery. Instead, because of natural increase, the slave population at the time of the Civil War was growing. The eventual abolition of slavery, while a significant milestone, did not immediately resolve racial inequalities. Many states enacted Jim Crow laws and adopted other discriminatory practices, and extralegal terrorist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan enforced white supremacy even when the law did not. Foreign policy before the Civil War centered around concepts like the Monroe Doctrine and Manifest Destiny. The Monroe Doctrine asserted US Hegemony in the Americas, while Manifest Destiny initially embodied the spread of democratic ideals but later became a justification for territorial expansion, especially following the Mexican American War. The Union victory in the Civil War allowed the US to emerge as a major industrial power, with the south becoming an internal colony supplying resources and markets for northern industries. The latter part of the 19th century saw the rapid settlement of the trans Mississippi west, accompanied by the displacement of Native Americans. The western frontier was declared closed by the 1890 census, and the US began to look beyond its borders, joining other colonial powers in establishing overseas territories to support its industrial and commercial interests. As with all of the lectures in this course, this is only a brief introduction that barely scratches the surface. We will follow this story and dig deeper into some of these topics, but this is a survey course, so we will mostly only be able to touch on important events. Think of it as surveying the landscape from an airplane at 50,000ft as the pilot identifies points of interest. In the next section, we'll explore some of the key themes that will guide our study throughout this course. Please proceed to answer the questions in the assignment on Canvas. If you have any questions, you can post them in the open forum discussion or contact the professor using Canvas Email.

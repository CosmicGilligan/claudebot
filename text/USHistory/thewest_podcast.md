**SARAH:** Welcome back to History Matters, the podcast where we dive deep into the stories that shaped our world and, more importantly, how those stories have changed over time. I'm Sarah, your host, and I'm joined as always by Professor Cosmic, our resident historian and expert in all things historical. Today we're tackling something really fascinating – the American expansion into the Trans-Mississippi West, but with a twist.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** That's right, Sarah. We're not just talking about what happened in the American West during the 19th century – though we'll cover that too. We're really diving into something called historiography, which is essentially the history of history itself.

**SARAH:** Okay, so before we lose anyone, let's break that down. Historiography – H-I-S-T-O-R-I-O-G-R-A-P-H-Y – is basically the study of how historical narratives change over time. It's like watching the same movie with different directors interpreting the same script, right?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly! And what we're going to explore today is how Americans saw expansion into the West during the 19th century, and then how that perception completely shifted in the 20th century. It's a perfect case study in how the same historical events can be told in radically different ways.

**SARAH:** And I have to say, Professor, this touches on something we all deal with today – the idea that there might be multiple versions of the "truth" about historical events. So let's start with the big picture. What was happening in the American West between, say, 1850 and 1900?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Well, Sarah, here's the interesting thing – most of what actually happened was pretty mundane. We're talking about cattle herding, farming, building railroads, establishing towns. Basic settlement activities. But Americans mythologized these events into something much grander.

**SARAH:** Right, and when we think about the American West, what's the first image that comes to mind?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** The cowboy, without a doubt. And this is crucial to understand – the cowboy became the quintessential symbol of America, both for Americans themselves and for people around the world.

**SARAH:** But here's what's fascinating – and Professor Cosmic, correct me if I'm wrong – being a cowboy was actually just a job, right? It wasn't this romantic, heroic profession we see in movies.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Absolutely correct. Cowboys were essentially doing manual labor – herding cattle across the countryside. It was difficult, often dangerous work, typically done by young men. Think about it this way, Sarah – imagine if today we mythologized construction workers or truck drivers as the ultimate representation of American ideals. Not that there's anything wrong with those professions, but we don't typically see them as embodying our national character.

**SARAH:** That's such a great analogy. So how did this regular job become this mythical figure? You mentioned literature, performing acts, movies...

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** The West became mythologized through Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, dime novels, and later Hollywood films. Americans saw the conquest of the West as the playing out of the American mission to spread its ideals and civilization across the continent. It was like a fulfillment of manifest destiny – this idea that America was destined to expand from coast to coast.

**SARAH:** And this mythology was so powerful that it actually became how both Americans and foreigners understood America itself. Professor, I know you have a really interesting example about this from 2003?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Yes! This comes from the Los Angeles Times during the period when the United States was contemplating the invasion of Iraq. Our European allies, particularly the French, were vocally opposed to American intervention. Americans were so offended by French opposition that we temporarily renamed French fries "freedom fries" – remember that?

**SARAH:** Oh wow, I do remember that! So what was the cartoon showing?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** The cartoon showed two mirrors reflecting how different groups saw Americans. On one side, you had how Americans saw themselves – a clean-cut cowboy wearing a star, a white hat, representing the good guy, the hero. On the other side, you had how Europeans saw Americans – a slovenly, dirty, smoking bandit waving guns around, standing in a pool of blood, wearing a black hat.

**SARAH:** So the same figure – the cowboy – but interpreted as either hero or villain depending on your perspective.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly! And in the middle was President George W. Bush, representing this tension. But the key point is that both Americans and Europeans thought of Americans as cowboys – they just defined "cowboy" in completely different ways.

**SARAH:** This is such a perfect introduction to what we're going to talk about today – how the same historical reality can be interpreted in radically different ways. So let's dive into our first major interpretation of the American West. Professor, tell us about Frederick Jackson Turner.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Frederick Jackson Turner was a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin, and he's actually quite important in the American historical profession because he helped establish the standards of professional history in the United States. But he's most famous for a thesis he wrote in 1893 called "The Significance of the Frontier in American History."

**SARAH:** And what motivated him to write this thesis?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** He was responding to a report from the Census Bureau that declared the frontier officially "closed." Now, to understand what this means, we need to talk about how the census works.

**SARAH:** Right, so every ten years, as mandated by the Constitution, the U.S. conducts a census to count everyone living in the country. The main purpose is to determine representation in Congress, right?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly. There are only so many representatives, and they have to be divided among the entire population. So every ten years, they count everyone and also create geographical visualizations of where people live. They can determine which areas are "settled" – meaning they have a certain population density – and which areas are still frontier.

**SARAH:** So when they looked at the 1890 census, what did they find?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Let me paint you a picture, Sarah. If you imagine looking at a map in 1870, you'd see a green area representing settled regions, and everything else would be frontier. By 1880, that settled area had expanded westward – now there are orange areas that were previously frontier but are now settled. By 1890, the pattern continued, but here's the crucial point – the Census Bureau concluded that the unsettled area had been "so broken into by isolated bodies of settlement that there can hardly be said to be a frontier line."

**SARAH:** So they're saying there's no longer a clear frontier because settlement is scattered everywhere?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Precisely. As the official report stated: "In the discussion of its extent and its westward movement, it cannot, therefore, any longer have a place in the census reports." The frontier, as a continuous line, no longer existed.

**SARAH:** And this is what prompted Turner to think about what the frontier had meant to American history.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Right! And Turner's argument was revolutionary. He proposed that the American character – all those traits we associate with the cowboy mythology – individualism, rugged independence, love of nature, the spirit of expansion – all of this came from the frontier experience.

**SARAH:** So he's saying the frontier created the American character. How did he think this process worked?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Turner imagined it like this: the first European colonists came to Virginia and New England, and they were essentially fleeing what he saw as the decadence of European civilization – high infant mortality, oppression, ill health, all the problems of old, established societies.

**SARAH:** So they're moving from civilization to... no civilization?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly! They move from a place that is civilized to a place where there is no civilization, and that means they have to create a new civilization from scratch. And it's through this process of creating civilization in the wilderness that the American character develops.

**SARAH:** But wait, Professor – there's a problem with this process, isn't there?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Yes! Turner recognized that as American civilization spread and became more established, it too would become decadent, just like European civilization. The very success of American civilization contained the seeds of its own problems.

**SARAH:** So what was the solution?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** The saving grace was that there was always a new frontier! When the East became too civilized and decadent, people could move further west and start the process over again. They could create a new civilization on a new frontier, and this kept the American character alive and vibrant.

**SARAH:** So Americans kept moving west, constantly regenerating their character through this frontier process. But then, in 1890...

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** The frontier closed. Suddenly, there was no more frontier on the American continent to conquer. And according to Turner, this meant the American character was now threatened. Without the frontier to keep America from becoming decadent like Europe, what would happen to American distinctiveness?

**SARAH:** This is fascinating because it suggests that American identity was fundamentally tied to this process of expansion. Professor, can you give us some of Turner's actual words about how the frontier created American characteristics?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Turner described the frontier as causing a reenactment of what he called "the civilizing process." He wrote about the progression from "savagery to the trader, the pathfinder and then ranch life and farmers and then denser farmers, selling and manufacturing and the factory system."

**SARAH:** So he saw this as natural progression of civilization, moving from what he called "savagery" to manufacturing society.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Right, and it's important to understand that at this time, people in industrializing countries like the United States believed this was the natural order of civilization. Manufacturing society was seen as the pinnacle of human development. This is the same thinking that led to concepts like the "civilizing mission" of the British or American manifest destiny.

**SARAH:** And Turner argued that this process created what he called "the striking characteristics of the American."

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Yes, and he concluded that because the frontier was gone, "the first period of American history" was over. Not that the United States was over, but that it would have to find its frontier elsewhere.

**SARAH:** And historically, that's exactly what happened, right?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Absolutely! After 1890, we start to see American foreign intervention overseas – in Asia and particularly in Latin America. The idea of expansion that had played out on the North American continent now spread elsewhere in the world.

**SARAH:** But the frontier concept didn't just disappear, did it?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Not at all! The United States began to think of the frontier as something less tangible – a scientific frontier, a literary frontier. And then, obviously, in the 1960s, we get "the final frontier" – space.

**SARAH:** Even though the physical frontier closed, the idea of the frontier remained fundamental to American character.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly. Now, here's a crucial question, Sarah: when Frederick Jackson Turner describes this movement into the West, is he describing something good or bad?

**SARAH:** Well, it might seem negative because it comes to an end, but I suspect Turner saw it as positive?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** You're right! Turner was describing what he saw as the civilizing process, and from the perspective of people living at that time, the civilizing process was the natural order of things. It was inherently good.

**SARAH:** And I think we can see this in the art of the period, right? You mentioned a painting called "American Progress"?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Yes! This painting perfectly captures the ontological outlook of Turner's era. It shows American civilization expanding from east to west. The East is depicted as clean and bright – which is interesting because, as we know, industry actually creates terrible environmental consequences. But from the perspective of people at that time, manufacturing was like Star Trek is to us – clean, technological, and inherently good.

**SARAH:** And what about the West in this painting?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** The West is depicted as dark, and we see animals and Native Americans fleeing before American progress. And from Turner's perspective, this was a good thing! They needed to be subdued or disappear because the natural order was that they would be replaced by American civilization.

**SARAH:** So Turner's underlying idea was about the advancement of enlightenment, which would have been considered unquestionably positive at the time.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Precisely. And this brings us to a crucial concept that students often struggle with – ontology.

**SARAH:** Okay, Professor, let's break down this concept of ontology because it's really key to understanding everything we're discussing today.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Ontology is what we know to be true without even knowing that we know it. I know that sounds strange, but think of it as the underlying foundation of knowledge that arises from culture and sets the standard for what can be considered true and what cannot be true.

**SARAH:** So it's like... the water that fish swim in? They don't think about it because it's just their environment?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** That's a great analogy! For people in Turner's time, what was ontological – what "everybody knew" – was that American expansion into the West was a heroic project that was expanding the American way, and that this was inherently good.

**SARAH:** And this connected to that American sense of mission we've talked about in previous episodes?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly! The mission of the United States to spread "liberty!" – and Turner would have put an exclamation point after that. The idea that the United States was at the forefront of civilization. This is something Americans internalized and believed really all the way up until probably the last half of the 20th century.

**SARAH:** So ontology is essentially "common sense" – what everyone knows without having to be told?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** That's right! In fact, there was a famous pamphlet written before the American Revolution called "Common Sense" by Thomas Paine. That was actually a challenge to what was ontological at the time.

**SARAH:** What was ontological then?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** The idea that to rule a large country, you needed to have a monarch. Thomas Paine wrote "Common Sense" saying, "No, that's ridiculous. People can rule themselves." He was challenging what everyone "knew" to be true.

**SARAH:** But Turner wasn't challenging the ontological beliefs of his time – he was endorsing them.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly! Turner was reinforcing what Americans already believed about their mission and their character.

**SARAH:** So now let's fast-forward through American history from Turner's time to the later 20th century. What changed?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Well, this American sense of mission continued through World War II. In fact, World War II seemed to be the fulfillment of the American mission – Americans came to the rescue of democracy and liberty throughout the world and emerged as the most powerful and prosperous nation on Earth.

**SARAH:** So for a moment there, it seemed like America had reached the pinnacle of its sense of mission.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Right, but World War II also opened up a lot of old wounds in American society that would challenge America for the rest of the century – civil rights, gender rights, and other social issues. And the United States abandoned isolationism to become the world's first superpower, entering into the long conflict with the Soviet Union known as the Cold War.

**SARAH:** And Americans saw themselves in the Cold War as defenders of liberty and democracy, right?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Absolutely. From the American perspective, communism was not democratic – it was actually antithetical to democracy, both theoretically and practically. So defending democracy became part of extending the American mission globally.

**SARAH:** And this led to American involvement in places like Korea and Vietnam.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Korea was relatively straightforward – Soviet-backed North Korea invaded South Korea, an American ally. That was clearly an extension of the Cold War. But Vietnam was more complicated.

**SARAH:** How so?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** The French had been fighting in Southeast Asia, but they weren't really fighting against communism – they were fighting to maintain their empire. However, they were able to convince the Americans that it was part of the Cold War, so Americans started backing the French. When the French were finally driven out, Americans stepped in to take their place.

**SARAH:** So from the American perspective, they were defending democracy, but from the Vietnamese perspective...

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** From the Vietnamese perspective, American intervention wasn't going to save democracy – it was going to perpetuate colonialism. So Americans were basically unpopular with almost everyone in Vietnam.

**SARAH:** But initially, Americans supported the war, didn't they?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Oh yes! The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was almost unanimously adopted by both the House and Senate. Americans went to Vietnam with the idea that this was a good thing, that it was their mission to defend and spread democracy.

**SARAH:** But something changed...

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** As time went by, Americans started to realize that what the United States said it was doing was not what it was actually doing. The U.S. wasn't defending democracy – it was just propping up a regime that couldn't survive on its own.

**SARAH:** And this was made worse by the draft, right?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly! Everyone graduating from high school – basically 18-year-olds – was subject to the draft. It didn't take long for them to realize that being drafted and sent to Vietnam didn't seem patriotic to them. This led to a mass antiwar movement that eventually turned most of the population against the war.

**SARAH:** So by the mid-1970s, America had lost confidence in itself?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** President Carter called it "malaise." Between the loss of the Vietnam War, Watergate, and other cultural upheavals, America lost much of its sense of confidence. If you look at the beginning of the 1960s, Americans were convinced they were at the forefront of history, that they were the good guys, that what they were doing was right. But by the mid-1970s, Americans were questioning their role in the world.

**SARAH:** And if you were a young scholar at this time, studying history...

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** You would be studying from a completely different ontological outlook than Frederick Jackson Turner had! Turner lived with an ontology of ever-expanding American progress. But scholars of the 1970s were questioning that and had a much more negative view of American expansion.

**SARAH:** And this leads us to our second major interpretation of the American West.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** In 1983, a historian named Patricia Limerick published a book called "The Legacy of Conquest," and it completely rejected Turner's thesis.

**SARAH:** How did Limerick reinterpret what happened in the West?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Instead of seeing American expansion as heroic progress, Limerick described what happened in the West as essentially a crime. She argued that Americans, driven by the profit motive, went into the West and basically destroyed things – ruined the environment, killed people, took over whatever they wanted – all in the name of profit.

**SARAH:** So this is a completely different outlook than Turner's.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Absolutely! This is much more critical. Limerick's work was one of the first in a series of works from this period that questioned and reinterpreted our understanding of what happened in the West.

**SARAH:** And these historians became known as...

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** The historians of the "New West." Now, it's important to understand – it's not that the West actually changed. All the events that happened in the West had already happened decades or centuries earlier. They don't change. But the way we tell the story of what happened completely changed.

**SARAH:** And what caused that change?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** We changed! The events themselves didn't change, but we – American society, American scholars, American consciousness – we changed. And that informed how we looked at events that happened in the past.

**SARAH:** This is such a crucial point. So you're saying that both Turner and Limerick were looking at the same historical events, but they told completely different stories because they were writing from different perspectives?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly! Turner's ontological outlook was that of expanding American progress. Limerick's writing manifested a kind of America in decline, or at least America questioning its own actions and motives.

**SARAH:** So here's the big question: which interpretation is correct?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** That's the challenge for historians! If we try to understand why Turner wrote what he wrote, or why people in the 19th century did what they did, but we do it from our own ontological outlook rather than theirs, we can't truly understand it. We can only see our own judgment of it.

**SARAH:** Give us an example of what you mean.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Let's look at Thomas Jefferson and George Washington owning slaves. We cannot and should not condone them owning slaves. But we can try to understand why they thought it was acceptable to own slaves. We're not going to change our minds about slavery being wrong, but we can understand their perspective.

**SARAH:** So the importance of understanding ontology is that we have to understand the point of view of the people we're studying.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Right! So when I ask whether Turner's interpretation of American progress or Limerick's interpretation of American conquest is true, the answer is that both are true to a certain extent, and both are false. But they're only true within their own ontological context, and they're false in a different ontological context.

**SARAH:** Professor, I think this is a good place to step back and define some of the key terms we've been using today, because these concepts are crucial for anyone studying history.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Absolutely! Let's start with historiography – H-I-S-T-O-R-I-O-G-R-A-P-H-Y. This is the study of historical writing, or the history of how we tell stories over time. Today we saw Frederick Jackson Turner tell the story one way in 1893, and Patricia Limerick tell it a completely different way in 1983.

**SARAH:** And ontology?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Ontology is an implicit organization of the world and its inhabitants. "Implicit" means it's not stated – everybody just "knows" it, but it doesn't have to be explicitly said. It's the underlying foundation of what a culture considers to be obviously true.

**SARAH:** And you mentioned two terms that might be new to our listeners – historicity one and historicity two?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** These come from a book I really like, and they describe the fundamental challenge for historians. Historicity one is what actually happened. Historicity two is what is said to have happened. Obviously, they're not the same thing.

**SARAH:** Can you give us an example?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Sure! Not long ago, there was a Super Bowl between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Kansas City Chiefs. The Buccaneers won 31 to 9. That's historicity one – what actually happened.

**SARAH:** And historicity two?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Well, if I'm a Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan and you ask me about that game, I'll say, "That was a great game! I loved it! Tom Brady won another ring, and Tampa Bay finally won the Super Bowl again. It was such a positive experience!" But if you ask a Kansas City Chiefs fan, they'll say, "That was a horrible game. It was awful and embarrassing. I almost wanted to cry."

**SARAH:** So same event, completely different narratives!

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly! What drives those different narratives is our ontological point of view. Am I a Chiefs fan or a Buccaneers fan? This is something we have to think about whenever we're considering what happened in the past.

**SARAH:** Because we're looking at secondary sources – people who have interpreted events through their own ontological lens.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Right! Frederick Jackson Turner interpreted what happened from his ontological point of view. Patricia Limerick interpreted it from hers. And on top of that, we have our own ontological point of view when we read their interpretations.

**SARAH:** So we might think Turner is completely wrong and Limerick is closer to the truth – but that's our own ontological perspective.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly! And we have to recognize that in ourselves as well.

**SARAH:** Let's also define primary and secondary sources, because these are fundamental to historical study.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Sources that historians use are generally texts, but can also be photographs, media, and other materials. A primary source is an uninterpreted document – it just is what it is. A secondary source is an interpretation of a primary source.

**SARAH:** So give us an example.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** The Declaration of Independence would be a primary source. A book explaining what the Declaration of Independence means would be a secondary source.

**SARAH:** And how does this apply to what we've discussed today?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Well, Turner's thesis is now over 100 years old, so we could consider it a primary source. Patricia Limerick's book, which interprets and responds to Turner's thesis, would be a secondary source.

**SARAH:** This is so important for students to understand – that they need to be aware of not just what sources say, but when they were written and from what perspective.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Absolutely! And this connects to everything we've been discussing about how the same historical events can be interpreted in radically different ways depending on the ontological context of the interpreter.

**SARAH:** Professor, before we wrap up, I want to make sure our listeners understand why this matters beyond just academic exercise. Why is it important for people today to understand these concepts of historiography and ontology?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** That's such an important question, Sarah. In our current moment, we're constantly dealing with different versions of events, different interpretations of what's happening around us. Understanding that perspective shapes narrative – that the same events can be truthfully described in very different ways – is crucial for being an informed citizen.

**SARAH:** It's like having the tools to understand why different news sources might report the same event in completely different ways.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly! It doesn't mean all interpretations are equally valid, but it does mean we need to understand the perspective and context behind every interpretation we encounter.

**SARAH:** And for students studying history specifically?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** They need to understand that history isn't just about memorizing dates and names. It's about understanding how people in different times and places understood their world, and how our understanding of the past continues to evolve as we ourselves change.

**SARAH:** The American West is such a perfect example of this because it's been so mythologized in American culture. We all have these images from movies and TV shows, but the reality was much more complex.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** And the way we understand that reality has shifted dramatically over time. Turner saw American expansion as the triumph of civilization over savagery. Limerick saw it as conquest driven by greed and profit. Both were responding to the concerns and perspectives of their own times.

**SARAH:** So what would a 21st-century interpretation look like?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** That's a great question! Contemporary historians are asking different questions – about environmental impact, about the experiences of women and minorities, about economic systems, about the role of technology. Each generation brings its own concerns and perspectives to the study of the past.

**SARAH:** And none of these perspectives is necessarily wrong – they're just asking different questions and emphasizing different aspects of the same historical reality.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Right! Though we do need to evaluate interpretations based on evidence and logical reasoning. Understanding that perspective shapes interpretation doesn't mean we accept all interpretations as equally supported by the evidence.

**SARAH:** This has been such a fascinating exploration. Before we close, let's think about what this means for how we approach history more generally. If you're a student taking a history class, or just someone interested in understanding the past, what should you keep in mind?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** First, always ask who wrote this source and when. What was happening in their world that might have influenced their perspective? Second, ask what questions they were trying to answer – because the questions we ask shape the answers we find.

**SARAH:** And be aware of your own perspective too, right?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Absolutely! We all bring our own ontological assumptions to our study of the past. The goal isn't to eliminate perspective – that's impossible – but to be conscious of it and to try to understand the perspectives of the people we're studying.

**SARAH:** It's like being a detective, but one who understands that both the crime and the detective exist in specific times and places that shape how the mystery gets solved.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** That's a wonderful analogy! And remember, this isn't about relativism – the idea that any interpretation is as good as any other. It's about understanding how perspective, context, and evidence work together to create historical understanding.

**SARAH:** Professor Cosmic, this has been such an enlightening discussion. Any final thoughts for our listeners?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Just that history is not a dead subject – it's very much alive. The past doesn't change, but our understanding of it continues to evolve. And that's not a weakness of historical study, it's actually one of its greatest strengths. It means history remains relevant and continues to help us understand ourselves and our world.

**SARAH:** And the American West – cowboys, frontier, manifest destiny, conquest – all of these concepts continue to shape how Americans think about themselves and how others think about America.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** The cowboy remains a powerful symbol, but as we've seen, it can symbolize very different things depending on your perspective. Understanding that complexity is part of understanding both the past and the present.

**SARAH:** That brings us to the end of today's episode of History Matters. We've explored how the same historical events – American expansion into the Trans-Mississippi West – have been interpreted in radically different ways over time, from Frederick Jackson Turner's 1893 thesis celebrating the frontier as the source of American character, to Patricia Limerick's 1983 critique of western expansion as conquest driven by profit.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** The key takeaway is that these different interpretations don't just reflect different opinions – they reflect different ontological outlooks, different assumptions about what's true and important. Turner wrote from the perspective of American confidence and expansion. Limerick wrote from the perspective of American self-doubt and criticism.

**SARAH:** And both perspectives tell us something important, not just about the American West, but about the times in which these historians were writing.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly. Historiography – the study of how historical narratives change over time – reveals as much about the present as it does about the past.

**SARAH:** For our listeners who want to dive deeper into these concepts, I'd recommend starting with Turner's original thesis, "The Significance of the Frontier in American History," which you can find online, and then reading some of the New Western historians like Patricia Limerick to see how dramatically interpretations can shift.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** And remember to ask yourself: what assumptions am I bringing to these texts? What questions am I asking that might shape what answers I find?

**SARAH:** Next time on History Matters, we're going to explore another case study in how historical narratives change over time. We'll be looking at how the story of Christopher Columbus and the "discovery" of America has been retold and reinterpreted over the centuries, from heroic explorer to symbol of colonialism to something more complex altogether.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** It's another perfect example of how the same historical figure can represent completely different things depending on when you're telling the story and from whose perspective.

**SARAH:** Until then, keep questioning, keep thinking critically, and remember – history matters because it helps us understand not just where we've been, but how we think about where we're going.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** As I always say to my students: live long and prosper! And keep studying history.

**SARAH:** Thanks for joining us on History Matters. I'm Sarah, with Professor Cosmic. Keep exploring, and we'll see you next time.

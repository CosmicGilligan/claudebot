In this segment, we will consider how industrialization led to an expansion of democracy, demonstrating why modernization presupposes liberalism. We will also examine how one of the main tenets of liberty, laissez faire capitalism, deviates from the aim imagined by its primary proponent, Adam Smith, and that industry requires government regulation to maintain a stable society. Lets consider the impact of capitalism on wealth distribution. Historically, wealth was confined to landowners. Capitalism enabled wealth creation without the prerequisite of land ownership, thus broadening the potential for wealth among a larger demographic. This leads us to a pivotal question regarding political power. What is the essence of the so called Golden Rule? I don't mean the Bible golden Rule, but the capitalist one. Whoever has the gold makes the rules. Those who control wealth also wield power. This principle, divergent from the moralistic version taught in religious contexts, dictates that wealth equates to rulemaking authority. Consequently, as wealth ownership diversifies, so does participation in governance reflect on the American Revolution, which we consider establishing the world's first modern democracy. The Founding Fathers, figures like Adams, Washington and Jefferson were not nobility but property owners. They established a system where they, the wealthy, governed. Initially, voting rights, which were left up to the states, excluded the majority, particularly non property owning individuals, from political participation. This historical context is critical. Even though the term property owning white males is often used with a negative connotation, it underscores the reality that wealth, especially in the form of property, was a prerequisite for political power. Recall our discussion of laissez faire capitalism. Adam Smith argued for the pursuit of enlightened self interest, advocating for minimal government intervention in economic affairs. This concept, embodied by the Invisible Hand, suggested that those willing to exert effort could attain wealth. Smith envisioned a system not characterized by stark class divisions, but one where competition prevents persistent income inequalities. However, the reality is different. Wealthy individuals and corporations tend to influence government policies to protect their interests, contradicting the principle of governmental non intervention. This dynamic illustrates how governments, rather than remaining impartial, often serve the interests of the capitalist class. Interestingly, many capitalists advocate for government non interference except in labor relations, where they prefer governmental support for the owner class over the working class. This contradiction is evident in political rhetoric, particularly among conservative circles. Reflecting on the COVID 19 pandemic, we observed significant government intervention in the economy, such as infusions of capital to prevent economic collapse. This intervention challenges the laissez faire doctrine, revealing the willingness of big business to abandon laissez faire when it is in their interest, but also the system's inherent brutality when left unregulated. History shows that governments like those during the Progressive Era and the New Deal, have intervened to regulate laissez faire capitalism to prevent social upheaval. Some conservatives have characterized this intervention as socialism. It isn't, but we'll deal with that critique in a later session. Finally, industrialization led to the emergence of the middle class. In the feudal system, society was divided into lords and peasants. The Industrial Revolution introduced the bourgeoisie and proletarians, but the developing complexity of industrial production and distribution necessitated educated workers, leading to a new managerial or middle class. Because of its numbers and the democratic nature of US Government, this class, when exercising its power, can be the ruling class. As shown after the Progressive Era and the New Deal. A demonstration of the potential power of the middle class can be seen in how many politicians seek to resonate with them. Even though many of our national leaders are patricians. Unfortunately, the working and middle class are often manipulated into acting against their own interests, a phenomenon known as false consciousness. Using the principle of divide and conquer, actors whose interests may be at odds with the middle or working class influence them by created divisions such as by race, ethnicity, race, religion, gender, or other attributes. This fosters resentment among groups whose socioeconomic status is similar, leading to one group being alienated and the other group developing a false solidarity with the dividers. Over time, industrialization has led to a generalized increase in democracy wherever it has occurred. But this journey is marked by complex interactions between economic theories, class dynamics, and political power. Since most of the wealth is controlled by a tiny percentage of the population, the rule still applies. Whoever has the gold makes the rules.

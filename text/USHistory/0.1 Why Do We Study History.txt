**SARAH:** Welcome back to "History Matters" the podcast where we explore how the past shapes our present and future. I'm Sarah your host and I'm here with my co-host Professor Cosmic professor of World History. Today we're diving into a fundamental question that every citizen in a democracy should be asking themselves: Why does history actually matter?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Thanks Sarah. You know this is one of those questions that seems simple on the surface but when you really dig into it it reveals layers of complexity that are absolutely crucial for anyone living in a free society.

**SARAH:** Absolutely. And we're going to start with something that might surprise our listeners. Professor in 2018 former President Barack Obama made a statement that really cuts to the heart of this issue. What did he say?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Obama said and I'm quoting here: "We're supposed to stand up to bullies not follow them. We're supposed to stand up to discrimination and we're sure as heck supposed to stand up clearly and unequivocally to Nazi sympathizers. How hard can that be?"

**SARAH:** Now that's a pretty direct statement. But what does this have to do with studying history?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Well Sarah Obama's words cut to the heart of an essential truth: in a democracy knowing our history is not optional—it's actually part of the responsibility of citizenship. When he asks "how hard can that be" he's really asking why it seems so difficult for people to recognize and reject patterns we've seen before in history.

**SARAH:** So you're saying that historical knowledge is actually a civic duty?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly. And that means moving beyond what I like to call "comfortable myths"—those simplified sanitized versions of history that make us feel good but don't actually prepare us for the challenges we face today. We need to learn to confront complexity.

**SARAH:** Can you give our listeners an example of what you mean by "comfortable myths"?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Sure. One comfortable myth might be that democracies are naturally stable and don't require constant maintenance. Another might be that extremist ideologies could never gain a foothold in modern educated societies. History shows us that both of these assumptions are dangerously naive.

**SARAH:** That's a sobering thought. Now you mentioned that without historical understanding citizens are vulnerable. Vulnerable to what exactly?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Well they're vulnerable not only to forgetting the past but to having it distorted for political ends. And this brings me to one of my favorite analogies about why history matters.

**SARAH:** I love your analogies Professor. Lay it on us.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** History functions for democratic societies the way memory functions for an individual person. Think about it this way: without memory a person is completely vulnerable to manipulation. Anyone could tell them who they are what they've done what their relationships mean and they would have no way to verify whether that's true or false.

**SARAH:** Oh that's fascinating. So you're saying that a society without a clear understanding of its past is like a person with amnesia?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Precisely! A society without a clear honest understanding of its past is open to exploitation by those who would twist history for their own purposes. They can tell that society whatever version of the past serves their political agenda and citizens without historical knowledge have no way to push back.

**SARAH:** This reminds me of that famous quote—I think it's often attributed to Winston Churchill—"History is written by the victors."

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** That's a great connection Sarah. And it highlights why we need citizens who can think critically about historical sources and narratives not just accept whatever version they're given.

**SARAH:** Welcome back to History Matters the podcast where we dig deeper into the stories that shaped our world. I'm your host Sarah and joining me as always is Professor Cosmic our resident expert in world history. Today we're tackling something that might make some listeners a little uncomfortable — the difference between historical myth and actual history and why it matters more than you might think.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Thanks for having me back Sarah. And you're absolutely right about the discomfort factor. What we're discussing today challenges some deeply held beliefs about American history particularly around events like the Boston Tea Party.

**SARAH:** Before we dive in Professor can you help our listeners understand what you mean by "historical myth" versus actual history?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Excellent question. When I use the term "historical myth" I'm not talking about something that's completely false — though some myths certainly contain falsehoods. Rather I'm referring to simplified sanitized versions of historical events that are designed primarily to instill patriotic pride rather than critical understanding.

**SARAH:** So it's like the difference between a Disney version of a fairy tale and the original Brothers Grimm story?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** That's actually a brilliant analogy Sarah. Disney's Cinderella is beautiful and uplifting but the original Grimm version involves stepsisters cutting off parts of their feet to fit into the glass slipper. Both tell a story about Cinderella but one is crafted for a specific emotional response while the other preserves the complex sometimes disturbing reality.

**SARAH:** And you're saying this is what happens with American history education?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Precisely. Much of what Americans learn about their past in elementary and high school isn't really history in the way professional historians approach it. It's often this kind of national myth — stories designed to make us feel good about our country rather than understand the full complexity of what actually happened.

**SARAH:** Now I want to be clear for our listeners — you're not saying patriotism is bad right?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Not at all. Pride in one's country isn't inherently problematic. But when that pride is based on incomplete or sugar-coated stories it creates problems. Citizens become vulnerable to manipulation and ill-equipped to handle complexity when it arises in contemporary politics.

**SARAH:** Which brings us to your main example — the Boston Tea Party. This is going to challenge what a lot of people learned in school isn't it?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** It absolutely will. The popular image of the Boston Tea Party is deeply embedded in American consciousness: noble patriots heroically dumping tea into Boston Harbor to protest British tyranny. It's a clear-cut story of heroes fighting for freedom.

**SARAH:** Complete with those iconic images of colonists dressed as Native Americans throwing tea chests overboard while shouting about taxation without representation.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly. But here's where it gets complicated Sarah. The historical reality was far more morally ambiguous than that simplified narrative suggests. The Sons of Liberty — the group responsible for the Tea Party — were what historians call an "extralegal group."

**SARAH:** Can you break down what "extralegal" means for our listeners?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** It means they operated outside and often in direct defiance of established legal and governmental structures. Think of them less like organized protesters and more like... well like a vigilante organization.

**SARAH:** That's a very different image than what most of us grew up with.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** It is indeed. And here's what really challenges the mythology: many respectable colonists at the time actually viewed the Sons of Liberty as dangerous thugs rather than patriots.

**SARAH:** Wait really? Their own contemporaries saw them as thugs?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Absolutely. Their tactics included tarring and feathering people burning the governor in effigy destroying his house stealing his property sinking ships and throwing rocks at soldiers. These weren't the genteel protest methods we might imagine.

**SARAH:** That sounds more like what we'd call terrorism or organized crime today.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** You're touching on something crucial there Sarah. Even the prominent founders of the time disagreed sharply about these methods. John Adams called the Tea Party "magnificent" and "absolutely necessary" but Benjamin Franklin was so concerned about it that he offered to personally pay the East India Company back for the destroyed tea.

**SARAH:** Franklin wanted to pay them back? That's not in the typical textbook version.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Not at all. And it gets more complex. George Washington privately called the Bostonians "mad" and disapproved of destroying private property. Some Massachusetts towns formally condemned the Tea Party as "illegal and unjust."

**SARAH:** So even at the time there wasn't consensus that this was a heroic act?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly. What we see in the historical record is a deeply controversial event that divided opinion even among those who opposed British policies. The myth-making came later simplifying this complex reality into a clear story of good versus evil.

**SARAH:** Now Professor why does this matter today? I mean this happened almost 250 years ago.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** This is where historical myths become particularly dangerous Sarah. They can be weaponized in contemporary politics. The modern Tea Party movement which emerged around 2009 explicitly associates itself with these Boston Tea Party "patriots."

**SARAH:** Right with the tricorn hats and the "Don't Tread on Me" flags.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly. They claim the heroic legacy while ignoring the violent controversial aspects of the original Sons of Liberty. Tea Party activists frequently invoke the imagery of colonial resistance presenting themselves as inheritors of America's founding spirit of resistance to tyranny.

**SARAH:** But if we understand the full historical context that connection becomes problematic doesn't it?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Very problematic. The Sons of Liberty used violence and intimidation tactics — methods that would be controversial or illegal today. When modern movements claim this legacy without acknowledging the complex often violent reality of their historical predecessors they're essentially using mythology rather than history to legitimize their actions.

**SARAH:** So they're picking and choosing which parts of history to embrace.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Precisely. And this is why understanding the difference between myth and history matters so much. Without understanding the full historical context citizens cannot properly evaluate whether modern political movements are grounding their claims in actual history or in convenient mythology that serves their political purposes.

**SARAH:** It's like they're saying "We're just like the Boston Tea Party heroes" while ignoring that those same "heroes" were tarring and feathering people.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** You've captured it perfectly Sarah. And this isn't unique to conservative movements by the way. All across the political spectrum people invoke historical precedents while ignoring inconvenient complexities. The solution isn't to stop learning from history but to engage with it honestly and completely.

**SARAH:** So what do you recommend for our listeners? How can they better distinguish between historical myth and actual history?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Start by asking questions that myths typically don't address: What did people at the time think about these events? Who opposed these actions and why? What were the unintended consequences? What moral ambiguities existed? Real history is messy contradictory and morally complex.

**SARAH:** And presumably if a historical story seems too neat and tidy that's a red flag?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Absolutely. History rarely provides clear heroes and villains. When someone presents a historical precedent that perfectly supports their political position without any complexity or contradiction be skeptical. They're probably selling you mythology not history.

**SARAH:** This reminds me of something you said in our off-air conversation — that being historically literate is almost like being inoculated against propaganda.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** That's exactly right Sarah. When you understand how historical myths are constructed and deployed you become much more resistant to having your emotions manipulated through historical imagery and rhetoric.

**SARAH:** Before we wrap up I want to ask — does this mean we should teach children that the founders were bad people?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Not at all. What we should teach is that they were complex people living in complex times making difficult decisions with imperfect information and mixed motives. That's actually more inspiring than mythology because it shows that real people — flawed struggling people like ourselves — can still accomplish remarkable things.

**SARAH:** And it probably prepares students better for citizenship in a complex democracy.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly. Citizens who can handle complexity and moral ambiguity are much better equipped to participate meaningfully in democratic processes than those who've been fed a steady diet of simplified myths.

**SARAH:** Now let's talk about countries that have really grappled with this challenge. I understand Germany provides a particularly powerful example of how a nation can confront its difficult history. Can you walk us through that?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Germany is absolutely the gold standard for this kind of historical reckoning. They teach their students openly and thoroughly about the crimes of the Nazi regime. And this isn't because Germans are proud of this history—they most certainly are not.

**SARAH:** Right so why do they do it then?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Because they understand that confronting the reality of those crimes is the best safeguard against repeating them. By integrating the lessons of the past into public education they aim to prevent the conditions that enabled extremist ideology to flourish in the first place.

**SARAH:** That's remarkable. It takes real courage as a society to look honestly at your worst moments.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** It does. And it’s crucial for our listeners to understand something here: the rise of Nazi Germany wasn’t the result of people “forgetting” the past. It was the product of deliberate choices by leaders and citizens who embraced an ideology of racial hatred and authoritarian control.
The reason we emphasize this history now is different—our generation is losing living memory of just how horrific it was. As that memory fades so does our sensitivity to the warning signs. That loss of awareness makes it easier for similar patterns to take root again without triggering the same level of alarm.

**SARAH:** Can you break down how quickly things changed once Hitler came to power?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** It happened with breathtaking speed Sarah. Within months of Adolf Hitler taking power in 1933 the Nazi regime had dismantled democratic institutions crushed independent journalism and replaced truth with relentless propaganda.

**SARAH:** Months? Not years?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Months. And here's the crucial point: these were not accidents of history. They weren't unfortunate coincidences or the inevitable result of economic hardship. They were calculated strategies to consolidate power silence opposition and prepare the ground for unprecedented violence.
And here’s where historical forgetting becomes dangerous for us today—if we no longer remember how quickly freedoms can disappear we are less prepared to notice when similar tactics are used in our own time.

**SARAH:** So there was a deliberate playbook being followed.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly. And understanding that playbook—recognizing those tactics—is one of the most important things citizens in any democracy can learn from studying this period.

**SARAH:** Now let's talk about the consequences. Because I think sometimes people don't fully grasp the scope of what happened.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** The consequences were absolutely catastrophic not just for the victims of Nazi ideology but for Germany itself and the entire world. Nazi aggression and genocide led directly to the Second World War. Germany suffered between 4.3 and 5.3 million military deaths.

**SARAH:** Those numbers are staggering.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** And that's just military deaths. There were also hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths from Allied bombing and Germany permanently lost a quarter of its prewar territory. But the human cost extended far beyond Germany's borders.

**SARAH:** What about the Allied nations?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Over 400000 American military personnel died in World War II alongside millions of soldiers and civilians from other countries. The Soviet Union alone lost an estimated 20 to 27 million people.

**SARAH:** Professor when you look at numbers like that what's the lesson?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** The lesson is clear: extremist ideology once in power destroys not only its intended victims but also the society that embraces it. And resisting it demands terrible sacrifice. This is why prevention through education and civic engagement is so crucial—and why forgetting the full reality of that history puts us at risk of having to learn the same lesson again at enormous cost.

**SARAH:** You know that reminds me of something Mark Twain supposedly said about history.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Ah you're thinking of "History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes."

**SARAH:** Exactly! So if history rhymes rather than repeats what are some of the concerning patterns you're seeing today?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Well Sarah this is where historical literacy becomes not just academically interesting but practically urgent. In recent years law enforcement and security agencies have documented alarming increases in hate crimes and extremist violence in the United States.
When the shared memory of past atrocities weakens extremist rhetoric that once would have been met with instant public outrage can instead seem like “just another political opinion.” That shift in public sensitivity is one of the earliest warning signs history teaches us to watch for.

**SARAH:** Can you give our listeners some specific examples of what you mean?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** The Department of Homeland Security has identified white supremacist extremism as the most persistent domestic terror threat. Anti-Semitic incidents have reached the highest levels since records began being kept.

**SARAH:** Those are official government assessments not political rhetoric.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly. These are threat assessments based on data not opinion. And here's where a concept from journalist Fintan O'Toole becomes really relevant.

**SARAH:** What's that concept?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** O'Toole talks about what he calls "trial runs for fascism"—deliberate attempts to desensitize the public to cruelty and dehumanization. The idea is that extremist movements don't usually seize power overnight. They test boundaries normalize previously unacceptable behavior and gradually shift the standards of what society considers acceptable.

**SARAH:** So it's like a process of gradual conditioning?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly. And understanding the historical record equips citizens to recognize these warning signs and respond before the damage becomes irreversible. This is why historical literacy isn't just nice to have—it's a civic necessity.

**SARAH:** Let's dig deeper into what you mean by historical literacy. What does that actually look like in practice?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Great question. Historical literacy means learning how historians evaluate evidence how they distinguish fact from myth and how they understand the causes and consequences of events. These are intellectual tools that citizens can apply to contemporary issues.

**SARAH:** So you're not just learning facts and dates—you're learning a way of thinking.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Precisely! It allows us to recognize when political movements are wrapping themselves in selective or distorted versions of the past to legitimize their actions. When someone says "this is how we've always done things" or "this is what our founders intended" historical literacy gives you the tools to evaluate those claims.

**SARAH:** That's such an important skill in our current information environment where anyone can publish anything online and make it sound authoritative.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Absolutely. And it's worth noting that the founders of the United States understood this principle very well. They drew on classical history the Enlightenment and the record of earlier republics to design institutions they hoped would last for generations.

**SARAH:** Can you give our listeners an example of how they used historical knowledge?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Sure. The founders were deeply influenced by their study of ancient Rome particularly how the Roman Republic collapsed into dictatorship. They designed checks and balances specifically to prevent the concentration of power that had destroyed previous republics.

**SARAH:** So they were literally applying the lessons of history to their institutional design.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly. And they saw themselves as acting not just for their own time but for what they called "millions yet unborn"—future generations who would inherit the consequences of their choices.

**SARAH:** That's a powerful sense of responsibility to future generations.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** And that same sense of responsibility applies today Sarah. Whether the issue is extremist ideology the climate crisis or threats to democratic institutions history offers both cautionary tales and examples of resilience.

**SARAH:** Let's talk about that—the examples of resilience. Because it's easy to get discouraged when we focus only on historical disasters.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** That's such an important point. History teaches us that democracies are never finished products. They require vigilance adaptation and informed participation. But it also shows us that ordinary people working together can overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges.

**SARAH:** Can you give us an example?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Think about the civil rights movement in the United States. Activists like Martin Luther King Jr. drew explicitly on historical examples—both successes and failures—to develop their strategies. They studied Gandhi's methods in India they learned from earlier labor organizing and they understood how previous movements had succeeded or failed.

**SARAH:** So they were strategic about applying historical lessons.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Absolutely. And their success demonstrates that historical knowledge isn't just about understanding the past—it's about having the tools to shape the future.

**SARAH:** This brings us to something I think is really important for our listeners to understand. You're not just talking about history as something that happened "back then."

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly right Sarah. History is not just something that happened in the past. It's being made now through our choices and actions. Every day we're writing the history that future generations will study and learn from.

**SARAH:** That's both exciting and intimidating.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** It should be both! By studying history seriously you gain the ability to recognize dangerous patterns evaluate competing claims and imagine better alternatives. You become more than an observer—you become an active participant in shaping the future.

**SARAH:** So when we study historical movements whether they're positive or negative we're essentially building our toolkit for civic engagement.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** That's beautifully put. And in a democracy an informed citizenry is the strongest defense against repeating the disasters of the past. The sacrifices of those who fought and died to defeat Nazism—and other forms of extremism—obligate us to guard against the reemergence of such ideologies in any form.

**SARAH:** Can you elaborate on what you mean by "obligate"?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** When millions of people died to preserve democratic values and human dignity their sacrifice creates a moral obligation for future generations. We owe it to them—and to ourselves—to remain vigilant against the forces they fought against.

**SARAH:** And that vigilance requires more than just remembering what happened.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly. It requires understanding why it happened and applying those lessons to our own time. We need to understand the conditions that allow extremism to flourish the tactics that authoritarians use to gain power and the institutional and cultural safeguards that can prevent democratic backsliding.

**SARAH:** Professor as we start to wrap up our main discussion I want to share a quote that I think captures the spirit of what we've been talking about. The poet Amanda Gorman said "While we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us."

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Oh that's perfect Sarah. That quote captures something essential about our relationship with history. We're not just studying it—we're creating it. And future historians will evaluate our choices just as we evaluate the choices of previous generations.

**SARAH:** So the question becomes: What kind of historical actors do we want to be?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly. Gorman is reminding us that the question is not whether history will judge us—it will. The question is whether we will be ready informed and courageous enough to make that judgment a good one.

**SARAH:** That puts a lot of responsibility on each individual citizen.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** It does. But it's also empowering. It means that every person who takes the time to understand history to think critically about current events to engage constructively in civic life is making a positive contribution to the historical record.

**SARAH:** And presumably the more people who do that the stronger our democracy becomes.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Absolutely. Democracy isn't a spectator sport. It requires active informed participation. And historical literacy is one of the most important tools citizens can develop for that participation.

**SARAH:** Before we close Professor I want to ask you a practical question. For our listeners who are convinced by this argument—who want to become more historically literate—where should they start?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Start with curiosity about the world around you. When you hear political claims about what "we've always done" or what "the founders intended" ask yourself: Is that actually true? What's the evidence? What context am I missing?

**SARAH:** So it's about developing that critical thinking habit.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Yes and then seek out reputable sources. Read books by professional historians not just popular narratives. Look for multiple perspectives on controversial events. And remember that good history is often uncomfortable—it challenges our preconceptions rather than confirming them.

**SARAH:** Any specific recommendations?

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** For understanding how democracies can fail I'd recommend Timothy Snyder's work on 20th-century Europe. For American history start with historians who examine both achievements and failures honestly—people like Eric Foner or Jill Lepore.

**SARAH:** Excellent suggestions. And remember listeners this is just the beginning of our exploration of why history matters. In future episodes we'll be diving deeper into specific historical cases examining how ordinary people have faced extraordinary challenges and exploring what those experiences can teach us about our current moment.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** I'm looking forward to those conversations Sarah. Because ultimately that's what history is—it's the story of how human beings have grappled with the fundamental challenges of living together in society.

**SARAH:** And those challenges haven't gone away. They've just taken new forms.

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Exactly. Which is why the conversation we've had today isn't just academic—it's urgent and practical for everyone living in a democracy.

**SARAH:** Professor Cosmic thank you for this enlightening discussion. And thank you to our listeners for joining us for another episode of "History Matters."

**PROFESSOR COSMIC:** Thank you Sarah. And remember everyone: you're not just studying history—you're making it.

**SARAH:** That's right. Every choice you make as a citizen contributes to the historical record. Make sure it's a contribution you can be proud of.

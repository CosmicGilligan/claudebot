Sa. Sam. I'm sorry, my good friend. Let me learn it properly from my guru, then I will teach you. Sa. You guys like my song? Yes, but. Yes. Well, I mean. I mean, is it kind of like. Yeah, that's kind of it. The reason why I picked it was because it's an Indian song and we're going to talk about India. And I don't know any. I know a few, but most Indian songs I know are like 20 minutes long, so I didn't think that you'd want to hear one of those. Maybe you would. I don't know. It would probably be better than listening to me, but that's what you're going to do today anyway. So how's everybody doing? Any questions or comments about anything? No. Are you guys good with your. With your midterms and all that? Everybody's getting along okay? Yeah. All right. Well, I don't think we've got anything really coming up. I just was looking in. We got on Monday, on Tuesday, we're going to start talking about World War I, and we're going to actually have two different sessions on that. And then next Thursday, we have Veterans Day, so you guys can take the day off in honor of me and all the other veterans that are here. And then we'll come back a week from Tuesday and we'll start over with, I think on that day we're going to be doing the Russian Revolution. But anyway, any questions, Comments coming up? Anything coming up? Anything I can help you with? Everybody's good. All right, I'm going to go ahead and start. Then you guys can see my slide. The Age of Imperialism. Yes. Okay. And I'm going to. We're going to talk about two different things today. They're kind of different and they're kind of the same. I don't know if you guys remember this. This picture I showed you the other day. And I didn't actually put the. The entire picture on here anywhere to look at, but this is the cartoon about American and British imperialism leading the world to civilization. Right. And so what. That's really what we're going to be looking at today is British and American imperialism. So that's kind of appropriate. Let's start off by talking about India. Here's the thing. I put a lot of. I put a lot of. I put a lot of information in here. I hope that we can get through it quickly so that we can do everything that we need to do today without having to go into another session. All right. But anyway, going back then, and mostly what I've got here just maps. So I'm going to talk over the maps. And so I want you guys to, you know, take notes and pay attention to what I'm saying, because there's not a lot of notes here for you. Right. But we'll go back and remember, at the very beginning, we talked about the Mughal empire. That was like the third or fourth lecture that we talked about. And it was. It was a successor state to the Mongols, and they took over the northern part of India. And then as time went by, it grew, and eventually it was. It covered most of what we call, or most of the Indian subcontinent. All right. And you'll also recall probably, hopefully, that one of the aspects of the Mughal empire was that it was a religiously tolerant empire. And the reason why that's important is because there are a number of religions in this area, the Indian subcontinent, and these religions are sometimes antithetical. So it's probably one of the great ironies of history that India or this area became the center of both Islam and Hinduism because Islam insists on one God and Hinduism consists of numerous gods. Right. And so they don't really. They don't really support each other very much. And what we see with the. With the tolerant. The religiously tolerant Mughal Empire was that everybody was able to get along and live in peace, regardless of their religion. But one of the emperors, the son of Shah Jahan, you guys remember Shah Jahan was the one who had the Taj Mahal built. His son ended that religious tolerance and insisted that everybody had to be Muslim. And that led to centuries, really, of religious conflict between Hindus and Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. Okay, any questions or comments about that? I want to. I want to talk about that now so that when we get to the 20th century, you'll understand why the Indians are acting the way they are. Okay, the other thing then is I want you to look at this other map. And this is. Doesn't even really. It doesn't even really. It doesn't really give. Give credit to how many different ethnicities there are in the Indian subcontinent. So there are. The last I read was there are 121 official languages in India, but there are over 21,000 dialects. And what that means is that when we say India, we're not talking about one place, we're talking about thousands of places, really, if you think about. Would be almost like saying that, it would almost be like thinking about the United States in terms of the counties in the different states, rather than in terms of the United States as one big country. Right. You guys follow me here. Questions, comments. And the reason why I bring that up is because the. One of the things that's going to. One of the ways that India will become independent is going to be by trying to regain or restore the Indian nation. But the question we want to ask ourselves is what nation? Where is this nation? Okay. And what. We'll just leave with that for now. And then also you can kind of notice here that when the British start to have their influence in India, that, that India was not just one place, it was a lot of different places. And the British ended up making arrangements with all these different places. And in the end, what happens is that most of what we call India today, actually India and Pakistan and Burma or what's the name of the place? I can't think of. Top of my head. Myanmar, I think, or something like that. But anyway, the point here is that, is that it was all pretty much ruled by the British East India Company. Okay? So the British East India Company was a trading company that was licensed by the king in England to trade in East India. Obviously, that's why they called the East India Company. And that's where you can see here where they actually started with the, with their, with their trading activities. But as they progressed, they would actually end up ruling different areas of India in the end. This is right before the British actually took control, took legal control of India or direct control of India. India was actually ruled. This much of India was actually ruled by, by the British East India Company. Okay? So if you think about that, that would be a lot like if Microsoft or Apple had. Had decided to run a country for the benefit of extracting profits, right? That's what we see happening in India. And then one of the problems obviously in India with the British presence is that the British consider themselves to be at the pinnacle of civilization, but the Indians don't, because the Indians have had a highly developed civil civilization for centuries. And so there is a tension between the British and the Indians where the British tend to think of the Indians as savages. And then of course, the, the Indians don't actually appreciate that. Okay, so there's. There is that. That kind of arrogance that goes with imperialism. And interestingly, if you think about it, when we talked about the, the democratic revolutions in Americas, in the Americas, one of the aspects of that was always the fact that the Europeans thought of themselves as superior to the Americans, even though the Americans were not ethnically or racially different from the Europeans. You guys get what I'm saying? So that's the Same kind of. That's the same kind of a. What's what I'm looking for. That's the same kind of a phenomenon we see here, except that the Indian people are different and they're brown and there's, There's a sense that I think, really, it's probably over simplistic to say this, but the browner you get, the more savage you are, according to the European way of looking at things. All right? Not that they can't be educated. And that's an interesting thing to think about because one of the consequences of. Well, let me just make the break here. Okay, so what happens is in 1857, the British East India Company had an army that was made up of Indian soldiers and they were called sepoys. S E P O Y Sepoys. And what happened was that the British introduced a new weapon. And the weapon had. When the what? The ammunition for the weapons. When you loaded the weapon, you had to take the ammunition out of a box. And it was, it was in a package that was coated with either, with either pork fat or beef fat. And what you were supposed to do was to bite the, the, the package and then put the bullet in the gun and shoot it. Right. But the problem here is that half of India is Muslim who refused to eat pork, and the other half is Hindu who refused to eat beef. Right. So what ended up happening was this was kind of like the straw that broke the camel's back. This kind of insensitivity to cultural differences that led to what's called the Sepoy rebellion happened in 1857. And the result of it was that it caused such disruption to the, to the trading of the British East India Company that the British sent an army to India and direct control over India. So the Parliament Then, from 1857 until the middle of the 20th century, the parliament actually directly rules India. Okay, guys, with me. And what's interesting about that is that because the Indians are being ruled by the British, they are subject to British traditions in a way. And one of the consequences of that is that the British start to educate all the people of India in Western philosophy. Essentially the philosophy of liberalism and nationalism. That was what was considered to be civil civilization civilized by the British. It was not completely unknown to the Indians. But what happens is that it ends up being ironic. And the reason why is because the principles that were the foundation of Western governments, like democracy and equality and those personal liberties and things like that were exactly what the Indians were deprived of. And when they were educated, that they had the same rights Equal rights with British, then that creates for them a narrative that allows them to demand independence. You guys follow what I'm saying here? So the British went in to extract wealth from the Indians, but they actually educated the Indians in Western ideology, and the Indians adopted enough of that ideology to demand independence. So in essence, the British educated their way out of colonialism. You guys follow what I'm saying? Questions, Comments about this? Okay, so. So now just before I move on at. India is going to become independent or actually. Well, yeah. Okay. Was it. India is going to become independent in 1848. This is what the British Empire in India looked like at the, in, in 1940. 48, right before independence. All right? And what you see is an enormous territory that was all considered to be India. Okay? And what's again, the interesting thing that we want to notice about this is that the British consider this to be India, but it hides the fact that there are still thousands of different little places in India that don't consider themselves to be the same as the next place over. And they speak different languages, they speak different dialects, they have different religions. And so there's a massive kind of diversity here among the population that the British ignore when they're ruling India. Okay, questions, Comments about this? I don't know if have any of you guys ever seen the movie Gandhi? I used to actually have people watch it, but it's. It's quite long. It's a really good movie. One of the things that, that was interesting, there's a number of things that were interesting about the movie, but one of the things that happened in the movie was that Gandhi was actually negotiating with the Viceroy of India independence. And they got into an argument about, well, you can't seriously think that we're going to just pack up and leave. And Gandhi said, well, if we refuse to cooperate with you, if we refuse to cooperate with an alien power, you will be forced to leave. And one of the generals spoke up and said, but Gandhi, India is hardly an alien power. British. India is British. You follow what I'm saying here? This shows this idea that they believe that this was theirs by right. And that, that the Indians didn't have a right to independence. All right, questions, Comments about this? Okay, well, was there a sense of, like, India, like the people, they have a sense of a nation? I. I'm saying. Well, that's what I'm kind of bringing up here is that for the most part, people in India didn't think of themselves as Indian. Okay? The only reason, the only way that they would consider Themselves Indian would be in opposition to British. You know what I'm saying? They were Indian. It's kind of like in the United States, in the American colonies during the Revolutionary War, the Americans didn't think of themselves as Americans except that they were Americans in, in contrast to the British. Does that make sense? So this is the same issue that Africa had because it's so divided. It's exactly. That they can't unite to push out these imperial, pushed out powers. Right. Because the imperial powers, keep in mind that what's driving the imperial powers is, is profit. Right. And so they don't, they're not interested really in human rights and, and that sort of thing or even, you know, they're not interested in cultural sensitivity or any of that stuff. Right. All they're interested in is keep everybody happy or keep everybody subdued so that we can continue to make profit. But the people, what I'm trying to say here is that the people really don't consider themselves to be Indian. Most of the people don't. Right. They, they're only Indian in that they're not British. Okay, so if you were from, say, if you were from the Punjab, then you would say you were Punjabi, right? And if you were, if you were from Bengal, you would say you're, you are Bengali, right. You wouldn't have really anything in common with a Punjabi except for the fact that you're not British. Does that make sense to answer your question, Bobby. Okay. All right, so now what happens then? And I guess I really didn't show this very well, but there, what, during the, the latter part of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century, there is a, there's a popular resistance movement against colonialism. And this is really, we see it in India, but we also see it in many other places. We'll see it in Africa and Southeast Asia and other places where the local people will decide to, that they shouldn't be ruled by foreigners and that they want to gain independence. And in India we'll see the rise of really two different groups of resistance proponents. They're not really fighters. Some of them are, but most of them are not really fighters. What they are is, is people who are agitating for independence. Right? And the two different groups are going to be the Indian National Congress, and this is going to be the group that Gandhi is in league with. All right? And then the other group is going to be the Muslim League. All right? Now the thing is that the principles of the Indian National Congress are driven by Western ideology. So what that means Is, and this is kind of the irony of it, this is what I've been kind of pointing to from the beginning is that Gandhi believed that India should be one nation, but that was really ahistorical. India had never been one nation. India had been thousands of different divisions. And so where did he get this idea of an Indian nation? It came from his western education. You guys get what I'm saying. He was educated in England, he was educated in London. And he came away with the ideals of western culture. And one of those was national self determination. So when we say when he. I want India to be one country, that was something that was not inherently or natively or indigenously Indian. That was a western idea. You guys follow what I'm saying here. And again, the idea here is that there's, I guess over 19,500 languages or dialects spoken in India that's today. Right. And 121 different languages. And so there really isn't, there isn't a sense of Indianness. It has to be built. And you know, we talked a little bit about this when we talked about the revolutions in Spanish America where for example, in Mexico and Mexico was actually made up of a bunch of different areas that in the end became together and created a country. And in that country created its own nation, its own national identity. Right. Just like the United States. The United States created its own national identity. There wasn't any nation there. Okay. Anyway, the point here, one of the major. And this is a different kind of a. Take one of the major campaigns of the anti colonial resistance was this homespun campaign. And what the homespun campaign is where it really shows us about this, the, the reality of the dependency theory that we talked about earlier. Does anybody remember what dependency theory? Somebody has to tell me. Remember, I remember I put the world in two different circles. Over the two different circles. It explains the relationship between the colonizer and the colonized. Is it kind of like the idea where the thinks that say that again? Is it like when the colonized thinks that they need the one to colonize them or the other way around? Well, they do because of the trading relationship between them. So what is the trading relationship between. Say I actually use this as an example. What is the trading relationship between India and Britain? Oh, well, the, the resources industry. Right. Textiles. Right. So what does, what does the British textile industry get from India? So. Right. Not soap. You don't make. They get the resources for that. Yeah. The raw materials. What is the raw material for textiles? Cotton. Was it cotton they used to get from the American south, was it cotton until the Civil War? Cotton, exactly. So the, the Indian, the British get cotton from India and then what do the British do with all those textiles once they've made them? They sell it back. Sell them back to Indians. Right. For cheap prices. Okay, so that makes a lot of money for the British. And one of the ways that the imbalance, I guess, between the British and the Indians was demonstrated was by this homespun campaign. Because what the homespun campaign did was it increased Indians to make their own clothes rather than buying them from Britain. And that's going to have a negative effect on the British economy because the British can't. The British economy depends on the, the Indians buying their textiles. Otherwise there's no point in making them. They just end up with a pile of T shirts. Right. You get, you guys get what I'm saying here? So this demonstrates it. And what's, again, what's interesting about this is that it's the same thing the Americans did before the American Revolution. The Americans said, we're not going to buy your stuff anymore. It was, I forgot what they call it. Non importation. There was a non importation movement. Right. And in the end, the British caved. So that's kind of just a demonstration of the, the, the reality of the, of the dependency theory that I talked about to you with you earlier. Okay, Any questions or comments about any of this so far? All right, so the last thing then, the other group that I didn't talk about yet was the Muslim League. And what's motivating the Muslim League is to unite all of the areas of India that are Muslim. Right. So this, you can see, isn't really a natural, or I should say it this way, this isn't really the same kind of an ideology as the Indian National Congress because the Indian National Congress is looking at all people as equal and the Muslim League is looking at only Muslims. Right. And everybody else is not with us. They're not the same as us. And what's, what's interesting, I think, is that the Muslim League was more natively Indian than the Indian National Congress. Because you'll recall going back to the very first slide I showed you, that there was a, there were centuries of conflict between Muslims and Hindus. Right. So I'm sorry, I don't know why I did that. But anyway, so the point here is that we have two different groups who are vying for independence for India. One group is vying for independence for all of India. And kind of in an ahistorical Way. And the Muslim League is vying for a Muslim India. Okay. The thing is that Gandhi and the leader of the Muslim League, Mohamed Al Jinnah, were allies for quite some time, up until the moment of independence. Right. So what ends up happening in the end is that the British India becomes independent. But it's independent. It's partitioned between. Between Muslim. The places where there was majority Muslim and the places where there was majority Hindu. Right. And they actually had an election to see which group would be supported. And the Indian National Congress was successful in much of India, but the Muslim League was. Was also successful in only the places where there were Muslims. Right. So what ends up happening is they divide. Oh, here's the Indian. Right. So you see here, the Muslim League was chosen in these two areas of India, and then the rest of it was chosen in the rest of India. Right. So what ends up happening then is they divide India into two different countries, India and Pakistan. But Pakistan is divided in two because there's a majority Muslim on two sides of the country, which was irrational. They did make that country, which is a typical Western way of doing things. But in the end, this area here, East Pakistan, will declare independence and become Bangladesh. That's in 1971, I think, or something like that. So that's basically what ends up happening. When they did actually partition India, there was. There were months of real bloodshed because many Muslims decided to leave India and move to Pakistan. And many Indians felt that they needed to leave Pakistan, but many Hindus felt that they needed to leave Pakistan and go to India. And it became bloody along the borders where people were actually passing each other. So there's a lot of hard feelings between the Hindus and the Muslims, even till today. Again, going back to this movie Gandhi. When we look at the movie Gandhi, we think of it as. We think of Gandhi as a real hero of India. And many people in India also do. But people from Pakistan don't think that way. They think he was a crazy old man. Right. So that shows that kind of disconnect between Pakistan and India that we see today with nuclear saber rattling. Okay, that's pretty much it. I just wanted to show you this flag here. It shows you the center of the Indian flag is a spinning wheel, which is a symbol of the homespun campaign that led to independence. All right, questions? Comments about any of this? All right, so just so you know, this is Jina, the Muslim League, the president of the Muslim League. This is Gandhi, obviously, and then this is Nehru, who became the first prime minister of India. All right, questions Comments about India. We're done with India now we're going to move to American imperialism. And some of this, if you've taken US History, you probably know, but I want to put it in the context of, you know, the world history. Okay, so first off, why. Well, the first thing we want to say, I think is that people will say, well, the United States isn't an empire. It's not an empire like Britain. It didn't go and take over a bunch of other countries. Right. Like in India and Africa and Asia. Right. But the reality is that the United States did actually do just that. Right? Because if you look at, if you look at the map of what has become the United States, when the United States gained independence, this much of America was what the United States owned. Then they got the rest of this yellow area here from the British in the Treaty of Paris that ended the Revolution. And then they bought this much territory, right? And then this territory became rebellious and independent and then later was annexed by the United States. The United States essentially negotiated this country from Britain and the United States conquered this territory here. And the United States bought this much of Arizona and New Mexico. So you can see then that. And also in, they got negotiated to get Florida from Spain. All right, so what you can see there is that over the course of the, of the 19th century, the United States built a huge empire, okay? But it didn't do it overseas because it didn't need to. All the empire that it needed was here on the North American continent. You guys get what I'm saying? So we can't ever say that the United States Wasn't Imperial until 1890 or something like that, because it was imperial right from the very beginning. Questions, comments about that. Now, in terms of American foreign policy, when it first became independent after the first president, Washington decided to set some rules for American foreign policy that Americans would follow for the next 120 years or so. Right? And these rules were these, that first, the United States would not interfere in Europe's affairs, and second, that it would insist on unrestricted free trade. Okay, now the first part of it, we think that, well, we know the reason why the United States did that was because it was weak and there were wars going on between Britain and France and there were people in the United States who wanted to support either Britain or France. But Washington was smart enough to realize that if the United States chose one side over the other and they chose the losing side, there would be no more United States. So he said, we're just going to stay out of that, we're not going to get into that at all. But the other part of it was that the United States insisted on the right to trade wherever it chose to trade, which was a violation of much of European law because Europeans were still mercantile, meaning that the colonies had to trade only with the mother country and not with anybody else, including the United States. All right, questions? Comments about this? Okay, so that sets the stage then for American foreign policy. What it really does is it points America West. Okay. And again, like I said, the United States is going to spend the 19th century essentially acquiring the rest of the North American continent. Okay. Oops, sorry. In 1824, as a result of the Latin American wars of Independence, you guys will recall that from 1808 to 1820, four, different colonies, Spanish colonies in America, became independent. By 1824, all of the Spanish colonies in America, with the exception of Cuba and Puerto Rico, were independent. Right. But we'll also remember that these independent countries in Spanish, what was Spanish America, were involved, beset by a lot of internal turmoil over whether they should be centralist or federalist or liberal or conservative. And the result of that was that these countries were politically weakened and really not able to recover from their indebtedness to Europe. And what that did was it led other European countries to start thinking about, well, we can go over there and rule, and that would expand our empire. When that became a kind of a movement or an idea among Europeans, the United States declared the Monroe Doctrine. The Monroe Doctrine says that the United States would view the establishment of any new colonies in the Americas as the manifestation, quote, the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States, end quote. All right, Now, a lot of people say, well, that means that the United States was threatening war. It doesn't mean that. In fact, it was very carefully worded to make sure it didn't say that. Because again, in 1824, the United States was incredibly weak compared to European powers like France and Britain. Right? So they basically couched their words in careful terms so that they didn't accidentally invoke a war with Europe. And then at the same time, they said, okay, we're not going to see. We don't want to see any new colonies in the Americas and we're not going to colonize Europe. Okay? And if you think about what was the European reaction to that, it was pretty much. Laughter. Okay, but the reality, because like I said, In 1824, the United States was weak, but the reality was that the United States would become more and more powerful when the United States was too weak to enforce the Monroe Doctrine. They didn't. But when they became powerful enough to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, they did. And the first place that we see that is in Mexico. You guys will remember that the French tried to recolonize Mexico under the Emperor Maximilian. And at the end of the American Civil War, the United States had the largest land army on earth. And that army marched to the border Mexico. And President Johnson sent an emissary to Paris, asked the French when were they leaving? Not are you leaving? But when are you leaving? And that caused the French to abandon Mexico. And that's why Maximilian was eventually captured and executed. All right, questions, Comments about this? So in the beginning, the United States couldn't actually enforce the Monroe Doctrine, but in the end it did, and it would for the rest of actually half of the 20th century. And you could even argue later than that. All right, but let's just. This is a cartoon that kind of shows the Monroe Doctrine, how Americans viewed Monroe Doctrine. That essentially that the United States was, I should say this way, that the Americas were the American sphere of influence. And remember that we talked about when China was divided into spheres of influence, there were the Germans and the British and the French, but the Americans really didn't have a sphere of influence in China. But they consider Americans considered their sphere of influence to be the Americas. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, Comments about this. All right, so now one, a couple other things I want to show you here. This is. I talked already about how the United States was occupied with or focused on settling the Trans Mississippi west after the Civil War. And this is a picture that kind of shows that movement of Americans to the west. And it's called American Progress. So why don't you guys tell me what you see here? Looks like they're all facing westward. They're all facing westward. Okay, well, they're, they're, they're going west. And who are they? Who do we see here? The fellow white Americans. Tell me about the white Americans. Okay, white Americans. What do we see in the East? It's kind of hard to see. This is a little blurry on the left side of. We see, I think, are what I think are Native Americans. Yeah, I think our Native Americans in Buffalo. Right? Native Americans in the Buffalo. Is it light or dark? Is it light or dark? Dark. Is that a train coming behind the lady behind. Yeah, it is a train. Okay, but look at the light. Look at the lighting on this picture on the right, which is the British. Sorry. Which is the East. What do we See Civilization. Light. Civilization. Right, exactly. And on the left, what do we see? Darkness. Right. And then when we look at the right, civilization. From an 1870 point of view, this is like Star Trek. You know, it's this beautiful. I mean, don't forget about the fact that, you know, industrialism is incredibly dirty. Right. But here it looks all clean and technological. And then we see this central figure. Her name is American Progress. But what do we notice about her? I mean, she's a massive blonde blimp. Right? But what do we see? What do we notice about her? American Progress. One thing you should notice as the Statue of Liberty saying, July 4th. July 4th. No, it's a book that brings what? Literacy. Right. And then also she's got a golden star on her forehead that's called the Star of Empire. Right? And then she's got these wires, which are what? Telegraph wires. So she's bringing science and technology and literature. And who's coming with her? The settlers. All the people that are moving. Settlers. And they are all wet European, blonde blimp. They are all European. They're all white. Okay, and then what, what about everybody else? Natives. Natives, yeah. Right. What, what are the. What's happening to them? Overwhelmed. They look like they're running. They're being driven away by civilization. Right. So now what I think is very interesting, it's interesting in many, many, many different ways, right? But in terms of our own, our conversation that we're having right now, this is very little different from that other, that other cartoon that I showed you where the Americans and the British are leading everybody to civilization, right? And so we can see that American imperialism was driven by the same kind of idea as British imperialism or French, or we'll say French. Okay, questions, Comments about this. Okay, now, last thing before we're done with this is in 1895, remember, I talked about how the United States didn't really enforce the Monroe Doctrine while it was weak, but as it became stronger, it became more aggressive with the Monroe doctrine. And in 1895, here's what's really interesting. You guys took, if you guys took US History too, more than likely you spent some time talking about the Roosevelt corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, which is interesting, but it's not as interesting as the only corollary. Right. Because this happened earlier. And what, what the, the incident here was, it was called the Venezuela boundary dispute. Okay? And what there, what it was was that Guiana here is British and Venezuela is Venezuela. Right. And this area here, nobody cared about, okay. Until in the 1890s. Somebody discovered gold in that area. And then the Venezuela said, no, that's ours. And the British said, no, that's ours. And the British threatened to send troops to America to enforce its claim over this area. And Venezuela asked the United States to arbitrate between the British and them based on the Monroe Doctrine. Okay? And the result was that the United States issued a document that was called the Olney Corollary. The Secretary of State was named Richard Olney. And the Olney Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine states that the United States is practically sovereign in the Americas and that its fiat is law wherever it chooses to intervene. All right, so if I say practically sovereign, what does that mean? What does sovereignty owns? Practically owns, Right. But yeah, sovereign means rule. Right? But when I say practically sovereign, what do you think I mean by that? I don't mean almost, not literally. It means in practice, the United States is sovereign. You get it? In practice, the United States is sovereign. So what the United States is saying is that the United States rules the Americas, right? Blatantly, outright. It doesn't hide it or couch it or anything. Right. And then it says its fiat is law. Well, what's a fiat? It's a little Italian car. Right? But it's more than that. Fiat is Latin for let there be. Like, for example, the. The in the beginning of the. Of the Bible. In Latin, God says fiat Luke. And that's the slogan of the University of California. Right? Fiat Luke means let there be light. And what happened when God said let there be light? There was light. Okay, so in this case, what the United States is saying, whatever we say becomes fact. Right? It's basically claiming Godlike powers over the Americas. Okay, you guys get what I'm saying here? So the only corollary then basically makes the Monroe Doctrine an instrument that makes the United States the practical ruler over all of the Americas. And even. Even though most of the people in the Americas, besides Americans, United Statesians, actually the Mexicans have a better word, the United Statesians. Right. But most of the people who were not estado unidentis didn't believe that the United States ruled over all the Americas, but Americans did. Right? And that's going to be the American attitude going into the 20th century. Okay, questions? Comments about this? All right, I'm almost done. Because most of this, we've already talked about the. The idea behind diplomatic split personality. Here's what's the problem. The problem is that the United States goes to someplace like Iraq and says, we're bringing democracy, we're supporting democracy. Right. And Americans believe that, okay? So now most of you guys probably weren't around when the United States invaded Iraq, but when the United States invaded Iraq, most people were against it. A lot of people were very sketchy about the idea of. Of sending troops into Iraq. And the reason why was because the United States had done that before in Vietnam, and it wasn't a very good thing to do, right? And so Americans were rightfully skeptical about sending troops to Iraq. And even making that even worse was the idea that many people believe that was only to maintain America's rights to Iraqi oil or Kuwaiti oil, whatever, right? And so what happens is that many Americans are against American intervention in Iraq until George Bush is able to convince Americans that we're really going there to defend democracy, right? Well, A, there wasn't democracy in Iraq, okay? And B, whether he believed that or not. And many people. It depends on how cynical you are whether you believe he did or not. But Americans did believe it. And after that, Americans said, yeah, it's okay, we should go and invade Iraq, right? But what's interesting is that it shows this disconnect in American foreign policy between, on the one hand, being the guardian of liberty and democracy, which is kind of what the United States took up after World War I, and on the other hand, being an imperial power, just like the British or the French, who were minding their own industrial interests, right? So what most people see both inside the United States and outside the United States, when the United States acts in foreign policy, like, for example, the invasion of Iraq, people say, oh, yeah, you said you came here to support democracy, but you really wanted the oil, right? And so that leads to this idea of American hypocrisy. Americans are hypocrites, okay? Because you say you want liberty and democracy and justice and freedom, but in fact, you're a rapacious imperial predator like every other country, right? And I think that's wrong. What we really see in the United States is that the United States at the same time believes that it is the beacon of liberty in the world and at the same time wants to make a lot of money, right? So there are really two different currents in American foreign policy in American life, too. And if you want to know more about that, take my US History class. But in American foreign policy, there's two different currents between this kind of liberal, idealistic view of America's place in the world and this industrial capitalist view of America's place in the world. And they're really in competition with each other. They're not the Same. So you could say that the United States actually has two personalities. It has both personalities at the same time. It has a split personality. And that what that tells us then is that Americans in their foreign policy or even in their domestic policy aren't necessarily hypocritical, but they are mentally deficient or mentally disturbed. Right. So anyway, that's kind of what that's about when you think about American foreign policy. A lot of people are very cynical. But you have to keep in mind that Americans have always really believed that America was at the front of democracy in the world. Okay? And then we talked. But I'm not going to talk into about the Spanish American War. I would just say that after the Spanish American War, the United States ends up with what's left of the Spanish empire, which includes Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippine Islands, right? And then there's a debate in the United States over whether the United States should. Should actually acquire an empire. And Americans will say, some people say, imperialism detrimental to American democracy. And you can look back historically, you can say whatever you want about this. Okay? And then on the other side, there was the group who said that if we include all these Filipinos and Cubans and Puerto can use that, it will dilute American democracy because only white people are able to do democracy. These two arguments are against Americans acquiring an overseas empire. The arguments in favor are, again, we talked about the white man's burden before, and again we talked about social Darwinism, which was that if the United States doesn't become an imperial power, it might fall behind. Right? So the. The outcome is kind of like this cartoon shows it very well. The whole world is watching President McKinley. And who do you think this is? Who do you think this is? Is it a Native American? Is it a native? A native. All right. A native of what? Poor portrayal of a Filipino native. Sorry, Poor portrayal of a Filipino native. Okay, a Filipino native or maybe even a Cubano or a Puerto Ricano. Right. But the point is here is that is the United States going to acquire control over these people or not? And the answer. Actually, the answer that McKinley gave was he went into his closet and he prayed and said that God told him that we needed to Christianize the peoples of Cuba and Puerto Rico and the Philippine Islands, notwithstanding the fact that they'd been ruled by the Spanish for 300 years. Right? And then our first, the very first Governor General of the Philippines said this to McKinley. Reportedly, our little brown brothers would need 50 or 100 years of close supervision to develop anything resembling Anglo Saxon political principles. And skills. So this is the. Again, the idea of the white man's burden, the white people bringing democracy. Okay, do you guys follow me here? Questions? Comments about this? What do you think about me saying all that about America's imperialism? It's our history. It's our history. It's our history. Does it make me sound like I'm anti American? No, just makes you sound pragmatic and like somebody who actually just follows history as facts. Actually just follows history as facts. Do you think that by me pointing out these things about McKinley and Taft were both American presidents, does that make me do. Am I painting a bad picture of these people? The question I want to ask you guys, you take into consideration when the time period into consideration is the. Of the time period, right? Yes. Because this was like, what do you call that? Ontological, right? This was like also anthological, right? I'm sorry? Ontological. Ontological. Ontological. Exactly. That's exactly right. So they were. They were men of their times, right? They saw the world through their eyes. That doesn't mean that they were right, but it does mean that they weren't evil necessarily. Right. You get what I'm saying here? We have to give them the benefit of the doubt about the fact that they actually lived it during that period of time and that what they believed was pretty common among colonial powers. Okay, questions? Comments about this? All right, the last thing that I want to talk a little bit about is this goes back to that dependency theory. This again is just like the little video that I put together for you, which by the way, I fixed the sound so you can actually watch it on the video recording. But at any rate, the point here is that we talked about the relationship between the metropolis and the periphery. Metropolis is modernized, diversified. The periphery is colonized in monostaple. And then the relationship is that the periphery provides resources and sometimes markets for the metropolis. But the dependency is because the colony's economy is monostable, meaning it's only providing one thing. It is dependent on the metropolis. Because if the. The market for the monostaple good falls out in the metropolis, then the economy of the periphery collapses, whereas metropolis will have other resources to rely on. Okay, you guys follow what I'm saying here? Questions, Comments about this? This is just a review. You guys remember this, right? And then what we saw today was how in order to control their access to the resources of the colony, the British imposed direct rule over India, right? And then we also have seen or will see how other countries, the Germans and the French, Italians will also impose direct rule over different areas of the world in order to maintain their empire. The United States doesn't generally use the direct rule. When the United States is colonizing a foreign power, it colonizes it using what's called economic imperialism. Right? And what economic imperialism means is that the United States, that's the metropolis, controls the economy of the periphery, but it doesn't rule the periphery. So an example would be, after the Spanish American War, the United States helped the Cuba to write its own constitution. In fact, it was written by an American admiral. And then Cuba was left to rule itself. But the United States maintained the right to intervene in Cuba if it acted in a way that was irresponsible. Quote, irresponsible. Well, in general, the way that it was intended at the time or the way it was thought of at the time was that to act irresponsibly would be to act against the interests of American companies. So American companies were heavily invested in Cuba in the Cuban sugar industry. And if the Cuban government tried to interfere with Americans access to sugar resources in Cuba, then the United States would send troops. Okay? And that's what it did. So, so what happens then is that this economic imperialism says, okay, you guys can rule yourselves, right? We won't, we won't interfere as long as you keep the money flowing. Right? But if you do something to stop the money flowing, then we're going to send in troops, okay? To fix things. Okay? And that happened over and over and over and again with the United States in Latin America. Not just in Cuba, but in many other places as well. Whenever the United States felt that its imperial interests were threatened, they would send in troops. Now let's just think briefly about the advantages and disadvantages of direct rule and economic imperialism. Direct rule, it costs a lot of money. And you're also on the hook for the infrastructure and defense and the education and health care and all these other things in another country. Right? But it is actually much easier to maintain control because you have military force right there, okay? On the other hand, in economic imperialism, you're not responsible for anything having to do with the internal affairs of the foreign country. You don't have to worry about education or health care or defense or any of these other things. But if there is a problem with your access to resources, then you have to send in troops which is very expensive. That's the trade off between direct rule and economic imperialism. One thing I should say before I end up here is that the United States wasn't the only country that practiced or practices economic imperialism. The British did it, the French did it, Germans did it. It happens all over the place, actually, more often in the 20th century because the united. Because in the 20th century, the idea of one country directly ruling another is pretty much off limits. Right. So since World War II, it's not really acceptable for any country to move in and directly rule another country. Except unless you're Putin is Russia and then you can move into Crimea, whatever. Right. But anyway, questions, comments about any of this. Imperialism actually was a one of the casualties of World War II. We'll talk more about that as we go on. Any comments or questions about anything we talked about today. Do we still practice this? Do we still practice this? Practice what? Economic imperialism. Do we do we send in troops when our economic interests are threatened? Yes. We send in CIA. Well, and we just said in deep state people. We don't send in our actual military. Actually, we do. We don't send in our actual, sometimes military. Actually we do. Most of the time we don't. But there's, I mean, the last time I remember anybody talking about it was when, not this time, but when Haiti was going through crisis before. And I'm pretty sure Clinton was president at the time and he was all set to send in the troops. Right now we're talking about the 1990s. So it's not like we've abandoned the idea of sending in the troops. Reagan sent troops to Grenada, which was kind of silly. But anyway, he did do it. He sent troops to Panama. Right. So the United States still claims the right to do this. And then you could also say, for, you could also say that that was part of the motivation for the American invasion of Iraq, that the people that Iraq was threatening American access to oil and so the Americans sent in troops to defend it. Right. But then you always have to also think at the same time, oh, yeah, but the Americans are the good guys. They're standing for liberty, freedom, justice, equality, all that. Right. That answer your question? Yes, I guess the answer is yes. Okay. Thank you. Any other. You know, I, I don't know if you guys have noticed this, but there's a, sometimes there's a time lag between when I ask a question and when I hear your answer. Right. And it makes it sound like I'm, I'm impatient. It's not that I'm impatient, it's just I don't know how long it's going to take for you to answer the question. You guys get what I'm saying? I, I don't want to stomp all over Your answers. I want to hear them. Okay. Okay. Well, I'm done then. You guys can go. Live long and prosper. I'll see you on Tuesday and we'll talk about World War I, one of the most interesting and one of the most destructive episodes in World War II. Have you ever listened to Dan Carlins podcast on World War I? Dan Carlins podcast on World War I? No, I never listen to podcasts. I have never listened to podcasts. Thank you, Professor. What's it.

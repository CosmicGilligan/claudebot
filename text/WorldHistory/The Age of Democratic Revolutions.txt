What if everything you thought you knew about the birth of modern democracies was a little, well, a little messier than the textbooks led on? We often hear these grand ideals, you know, the inevitable march of progress. But history, well, it always has a few more complex and often pretty surprising stories up its sleeve. Indeed. And I think those traditional narratives, especially, you know, the ones common in Western historiography, they, they can sometimes gloss over the profound complexities, the stark contradictions, and frankly, the significant human cost that came with these really transformative periods. It's easy to simplify, but the reality is always much, much more nuanced. Absolutely. So today we're taking a deep dive into what's widely known as the Age of Democratic Revolutions. This is a pivotal period, roughly spanning the late 18th to the early 19th centuries. And we'll be zeroing in on three monumental uprisings, the American, the French and the Haitian Revolutions, and really trying to uncover the unexpected and often quite divergent paths they ended up carving. Our mission today, I suppose, is to try and cut through some of those, let's call them, conventional narratives, and really extract the most important nuggets of knowledge from our sources. Okay. We'll meticulously examine their root causes, look at their evolving ideological foundations and their often surprising long term consequences, and ultimately we'll be asking, how democratic was this age really in its practical application, you know, on the ground? And what does that answer, which I suspect is multifaceted, what does that mean for how we understand history today and progress and even, you know, the very definition of freedom? Precisely. Big questions. Okay, so let's unpack this. Let's start with that spark across the Atlantic, the American Revolution. It's often presented as this singular, clear cut find fight for liberty, almost like a spontaneous eruption. But the seeds of discontent and really the groundwork for a truly independent mindset, they were actually sown much earlier, weren't they, in an era surprisingly known as benign neglect? That's exactly right. And what's fascinating here is that this period, roughly from 1690 to 1760, saw the American colonies largely governing themselves. There wasn't much direct interference from Britain. Why was that? Were they just not interested? Well, England was incredibly preoccupied with its own internal politics, particularly the turmoil and the ongoing questions of legitimacy following the Glorious Revolution. Ah, right. William and Mary. Exactly. The quote unquote bloodless revolution that placed William and Mary on the throne after James II fled, but crucially didn't fully abdicate his claim. So for decades after that, this political upheaval back in Britain meant The colonies sort of fell off the radar. They had bigger fish to fry at home. So because England was so intensely focused on its own domestic squabbles, they essentially just left the colonies to their own devices? Pretty much. Each colony developed its own elected assembly. They functioned almost like little independent countries, all while, you know, theoretically remaining under the king. It sounds almost like a happy accident, a kind of unintentional incubator for self governance. But was it truly benign? I mean, were there no attempts by Britain to acute control at all? Or were they just sort of ineffective? That's a crucial question. And benign neglect does suggest a complete hands off approach which isn't quite right. There were still trade regulations like the Navigation Acts. Okay. But they were often loosely enforced. The key really was the lack of direct political oversight and importantly, heavy taxation from London. Ah, okay. So when Britain did try to assert more control later, after the Seven Years War, it felt like a radical imposition, a shock to the system rather than just restoring how things used to be. Because they weren't used to it. Exactly. This era fostered a deep sense of self reliance and, you know, de facto independence among the colonists. Yeah, they were accustomed to levying their own taxes in their assemblies, raising their own militias and passing their own local laws. Things like the Massachusetts General Court or the Virginia House of Burgesses. Precisely. Those institutions had been operating for generations, building a political culture that was already quite distinct from the mother country. This practical autonomy profoundly shapes the colonial mindset towards self governance. It made them particularly sensitive, you could say almost allergic to any perceived infringements on their growing sense of liberty. And this unique situation, the sort of practice run at independence, set the stage perfectly for what came next. The Seven Years War, which depending on where you are, you might call the French and Indian War or the Great War for Empire. Right, different names for the same massive conflict running roughly 1754 actually started a bit earlier in America to 1763. It dramatically altered everything. Yeah, it wasn't just a localized skirmish in the wilderness, was it? It quickly escalated into a truly global conflict. It technically began with what seemed like a minor incident in the backwoods of Pennsylvania. It involved a young, ambitious George Washington. Ah, Washington again. Yes. And a French ambassador who unfortunately for him, ended up dead under disputed circumstances. That seemingly small incident spiraled into a full blown world war between England and France. A colossal battle for imperial dominance, really fought across the globe. Not just North America then. Oh no. North America, the Caribbean, South America, Asia, India. It was truly a global contest for supremacy involving vast expenditures and resources. On both sides. And initially the British, maybe still in that benign neglect mindset, or perhaps just underestimating the scale, told the American colonies, okay, defend yourselves. They did. But the individual colonies just couldn't unite electively. They couldn't mount a coordinated defense against the French and their Native American allies. So Britain had to step in. Exactly. Britain was ultimately forced to send significant numbers of its own professional troops, the Red Goats, over to North America. And here's where it gets really interesting for the relationship. This direct interaction with British soldiers, which became a daily reality for many colonists, started breeding deep resentment and a new potent sense of difference. Ah, okay, tell me more about that. This point is absolutely crucial for understanding the burgeoning of American identity. Before this war, colonists mainly identified with their specific colony. You were a Virginian or from Massachusetts or Pennsylvania. Right. And maybe generally as subjects of the British king, but distinct from each other. But then you have these highly disciplined and often rather arrogant British troops quartered in American homes under laws like the Quartering act, right, which was hugely unpopular. Hugely unpopular. It forced families to house and feed soldiers, often leading to, as our source puts it, blatant disrespect and profound frict. Imagine, if you will, a devout Puritan family in Massachusetts suddenly forced to house, say, 10 foul mouthed, hard drinking, disrespectful British soldiers who are, as the source vividly describes, maybe chasing your daughter around or damaging her property. Wow. That's not just an inconvenience or a tax burden. That's a direct, visceral cultural clash. A personal violation. Precisely. It exposed these deep cultural cleavages between the colonists and the imperial soldiers. Differences in manners, religion, social behavior, even just daily habits. That's a powerful image and it really drives home the shift. It led to this fascinating psychological change, didn't it? Where Americans, who previously might have accepted being seen as, I don't know, lower or provincial by Europeans, started to flip the script, they did. They began to see themselves not just as distinct, but actually as better than Europeans. Better how? Cleaner, maybe more virtuous. With a faster growing population, surprisingly low incident mortality compared to Europe and a booming dynamic economy. They saw opportunity and progress versus what they perceived as European corruption and stagnation. And this burgeoning self perception crystallized into something historians call Creole patriotism. Explain that term. Sure. Now, when we say Creole here, in this context, we're not necessarily referring to mixed race individuals, though that's another usage of the term here. It means someone born in America whose parents came from somewhere else. Typically, Europe got It American born European descent. Right. These American born individuals, seeing themselves as distinct from their European counterparts, had already developed their own self governing institutions, their own local economies, their own unique cultural practices. Over those generations of benign neglect, they were already practicing a form of self determination, building a society that felt different. Exactly. It felt inherently different. So when the British tried to reassert control after the war, it wasn't just seen as a policy dispute. It felt like a perceived assault on a developed identity, a nascent American way of life that felt to them more virtuous and progressive than the old European order. And this fostered a shared sense of unity across the colonies against this common perceived oppressor. Yes, it absolutely helped lay the psychological groundwork for revolution. It started to bridge some of those intercolonial differences. Okay, so Britain wins the Seven Years War, but incurs massive debt doing so. And Parliament decides. Right. The Americans benefited from this war. They should help pay for it. Makes sense from their perspective. But they decide to impose taxes like the Stamp act without any American representatives sitting in Parliament in London. And this, as you said, hit an incredibly raw nerve. It did. Because this wasn't just about the money, though. No one likes taxes. It was about a fundamental principle that deeply rooted in the philosophical writings of John Locke, whose ideas were very influential in the colonies. Talk about Locke's argument here. Okay, Americans were already paying taxes, remember, but those taxes were levied by their local colonial assemblies, assemblies they had elected and therefore consented to. Right? Consent of the governed. Precisely. Locke's argument, which was widely read and discussed, was absolutely clear. Legitimate government requires the consent of the governed for taxation. Without that consent, he argued, it's not taxation, it's theft. Plain and simple. Theft by the government itself. Yes. And if a government engages in such theft against its own people, Locke argued, it places itself in a state of war with them. Wow. A state of war. That's strong language. It is. And in such a state, according to Locke, people have not just a right, but a right and even a duty to defend my liberty. And for Locke, liberty was deeply intertwined with property from what is essentially an act of aggression by their own rulers. This conceptual shift is what's so profound, isn't it? It elevated the whole debate from just, you know, a squabble over taxes to a fundamental violation of natural rights, a breaking of the social contract between the government and the people. It provided the intellectual, the philosophical justification for something much bigger for revolution. It framed resistance not just as possible, but as moral as necessary. Now, you mentioned property being central to Locke's idea of liberty. How quickly did the revolution's focus shift or expand? Expand from just protecting property rights, which seems like a fairly conservative elite concern, to embracing broader, more radical human rights? That's a really key evolution because as the Declaration of Independence shows, it radicalized quite rapidly from those initial Lockean premises about property. So the argument for revolution drawing directly from Locke was indeed initially about throwing off a government that took property without consent. Makes sense. But the American revolutionaries, the leaders who were largely, let's be frank, the rich people, the wealthy landowners, merchants, lawyers. The ones with the most property to lose. Exactly. They quickly realized they couldn't rally the general population, the farmers, the artisans, the laborers, to fight and potentially die merely to protect their estates or their warehouses. Yeah, come risk your life so my taxes don't go up Isn't exactly a winning slogan, is it? Not really. Why would an ordinary farmer or a common laborer put their life on the line just to protect someone else's wealth or to avoid a few pence more on stamps or tea? The elite, if they truly wanted a broad based movement, needed a much more universal, more inspiring appeal. So the definition of liberty had to expand dramatically. It began to shift, moving beyond mere property. And that's where the Declaration of Independence comes in. Precisely. Instead of just Locke's original interpretation of all men are created equal, which many at the time understood as referring primarily, maybe even exclusively, to property owning men. Right. The Declaration, penned largely by Thomas Jefferson, broadened that definition significantly. It expanded to encompass personal liberties, rights, human rights, civic rights like freedom of speech and freedom of the press, freedom of religion and, and the right to a jury trial. That was a truly massive ideological leap, wasn't it? From a conservative tax dispute among the elite to this radical affirmation of universal human dignity and rights. It absolutely was. And this transformation is precisely why the American Revolution, which arguably began as a conservative revolution, focused on preserving existing rights against perceived encroachment, became profoundly radicalized into a revolution about fundamental universal human rights. By its conclusion, even if the application of those rights was, shall we say, imperfect at the time, highly imperfect, especially concerning slavery and the rights of women and non property owners. But the ideal itself, this expanded vision of liberty would have significant global repercussions. It shifted the conversation from the specific rights of Englishmen to the universal rights of man, influencing movements and thinkers far beyond America's shores for centuries. Okay, so they've got the ideals, they've got the justification, but then they actually had to win the war. And despite all military Logic against the mightiest empire of the day. They did. They did. Anybody looking at it objectively at the time would have said they couldn't possibly defeat the British Empire. Their army was ragtag, poorly equipped, often unpaid. Against the professional redcoats and the Royal Navy. Exactly. But they did win. And the undisputed key to this unlikely victory was getting help from outside. Specifically, an alliance with France. Ah, France. Britain's arch rival. Precisely. What's fascinating here, and often gets overlooked in the kind of triumphant narrative of liberty, is why France joined. France was Britain's great imperial enemy, and they were still stinging from being the substantial losers in the Seven Years War. They'd lost virtually all their holdings in North America to Britain. So revenge. Primarily, yes. They joined the fight not out of some deep ideological commitment to spreading liberty or Enlightenment ideals. I mean, France was still an absolute monarchy under Louis xvi, right? Not exactly a beacon of democracy itself. Not at all. They joined purely out of a desire to strategically hurt England, to weaken their main rival. It was a pragmatic, almost cynical geopolitical calculation, not an ideological one. France actually feared the American idea of liberty and the potential revolutionary contagion it might represent for its own subjects back home. That's such a crucial detail. It really shows how geopolitics and these practical alliances can shape history in profound ways, even when the underlying values of the Allies are completely opposed. Absolutely strange bedfellows. Driven by mutual interest against a common enemy. So the war is won, independence secured, then comes the challenge of building a nation. The U.S. constitution of 1787 then came along, trying to embody many of those Enlightenment principles we talked about. Yes, things like representative democracy, secularism, capitalism, what our source calls classical liberalism or liberty with an exclamation point. Okay, unpack that phrase. Classical liberalism or liberty with an exclamation point. What did that actually mean in practice for how the new American government was structured compared to maybe the more radical ideals we'll see later in France? Good question. Classical liberalism, as enshrined in the U.S. constitution, primarily prioritized individual property rights limited to government intervention in the economy and the protection of certain key individual freedoms. Speech, religion, press, assembly. So limiting government power. Yes, creating a system that prevented tyranny both from the government and potentially from the masses. Hence things like the electoral College or the indirect election of senators. Initially, it aimed to foster economic growth through free markets and protect the existing social order while granting significant freedoms. But primarily to a specific segment of the population, primarily property owning white men. Overwhelmingly, yes. That liberty wasn't Universal in practice, it was designed to protect their rights and interests. It was a revolution for rights, but not necessarily for universal equality in the way the French would later articulate it. Especially when you consider the millions of enslaved people in America at the time, or the indigenous populations whose lands were central to expansion. That distinction becomes stark later on. And this unexpected victory against the odds, against the mightiest empire of its day, it seems to have instilled in the newly formed United States this profound sense of mission. It really did. Thomas Paine, in his wildly influential pamphlet Common Sense, captured it beautifully when he wrote, we have the opportunity to begin the world anew. There's this powerful feeling of exceptionalism. So America didn't just win its independence, it emerged with this almost messianic belief. You could say that a belief that the spark of liberty struck there in America would inevitably ignite a flame that will encompass the world. That monarchies would spontaneously crumble and be replaced by liberal republican governments modeled on the American experiment. A rather optimistic view of how history works. Very optimistic. And perhaps a bit naive about the complex, often bloody realities that would unfold as those ideas traveled and were interpreted in vastly different contexts. And that vision, that belief in a universal mission, sets the stage perfectly for the next great upheaval. We need to discuss the French Revolution, because as that spark of liberty crossed the Atlantic, it landed in a nation utterly unlike the fledgling American colonies. A nation simmering with its own deep seated resentments, its own unique pressures, and ripe for an upheaval that would be far more sweeping, far more radical, and ultimately far more violent. Tell us about the cauldron that was the ancien regime in France, Right? The ancient regime, the old order in France was truly a powder keg waiting to explode. By the late 1780s, the French government was essentially bankrupt. Why? What happened? Years and years of costly wars, particularly against England, had drained the treasury. And then, ironically, their significant financial and military support for the American Revolution pushed them over the edge, financially helping birth. American liberty bankrupted the French monarchy. Wow. And it wasn't just financial problems, was it? No, not at all. On top of the fiscal crisis, you had consecutive bad harvests in the years leading up to 1789. This led to severe famine, particularly in the cities. The price of bread, which was the absolute staple food for most of the population, skyrocketed to exorbitant levels. People were starving, literally starving. This resulted in widespread street demonstrations, riots, people demanding bread. And it's in this context that you get the famous, though probably apocryphal, Quote attributed to Queen Marie Antoinette, let them eat cake. Yeah. Whether she said it or not, it perfectly symbolizes that horrifying disconnect, doesn't it? The monarchy seemed completely out of touch with the suffering of the populace. It fueled massive public outrage. Absolutely. It highlighted the chasm between the privileged elite at Versailles and the struggling masses. And we have to remember the underlying structure of French society. Those archaic three estates inherited from the Middle Ages. Right. Remind us what they were. You had the first estate, which was the clergy. Their role was ostensibly to mediate salvation, pray for the kingdom. Okay. The second Estate was the nobility. Their traditional role was to protect, to fight. And then you had the third estate, which was everyone else. Everyone else. So the vast majority of people. The vast majority, maybe 97% of the population, from wealthy merchants and lawyers, the bourgeoisie, down to urban workers, artisans and the huge number of rural peasants, their role was essentially to work and pay the taxes that supported the other two estates. And by the late 18th century, the system was completely broken, wasn't it? Utterly dysfunctional and deeply, deeply unjust. The nobles who were supposed to protect, often lived off inherited wealth and privileges like exemption from most taxes, while still demanding old feudal dues from peasants. They were more concerned with court intrigue than national defense. And the clergy, the higher clergy, bishops and abbots, often lived lavishly, drawn from noble families holding vast lands, also largely tax exempt, they sometimes abused their positions. While parish priests might be closer to the people, but still part of the privileged first estate. So the third estate, the peasants, the workers, the bourgeoisie, they were snuck, exploited by the nobles, maybe feeling neglected or abused by the Church, paying almost all the taxes and knowing things weren't right, but essentially powerless against the combined weight of the first two estates. Exactly. Powerless, like, because the system was rigged against them. This was the inherent injustice of the ancient regime that those Enlightenment ideals we talked about, liberty, equality, sought to directly challenge. And the King, Louis xvi, facing bankruptcy, makes this fateful decision. In a desperate last ditch attempt to get the privileged orders to agree to pay taxes, he's forced to call the Estates General. Right. A traditional representative assembly. Yeah, sort of like a parliament, but it hadn't actually met for 175 years, since 1614. Wow. So nobody really knew how it's supposed to work anymore. Pretty much. And here's the kicker, the structural flaw that doomed it from the start, the voting system, Traditionally it was one vote per state, not one vote per person. No. So no matter how many millions of people the third Estate represented, the nobles first estate and clergy. Second Estate, with their combined two votes, could always outvote the Third Estate. One vote, which meant the privileged orders could block any meaningful reform. Especially tax reform. Precisely. It was a recipe for deadlock and frustration. The King's decision to call this body, hoping it would solve his financial problems, unknowingly opened the floodgates to revolutionary upheaval. The Third Estate came to Versailles for the Estates General, armed with long lists of grievances. The famous Cahiers de Doliance. What were they demanding? Fundamental reforms, fairer taxes, an end to aristocratic privilege, regular meetings of the Estates General, and, crucially, voting by head, not by estate. And when those demands were ignored, when the first and Second Estates refused to budge, it wasn't just seen as a political disagreement anymore. It felt like a profound rejection of the very idea of popular representation. A flap in the face to the nation. And that's when things really kicked off. The Tennis court oath. Exactly. The Third Estate, now significantly bolstered by the articulate and increasingly powerful bourgeoisie, these educated, often prosperous city dwellers, who had economic clout but lacked political voice and infused with those Enlightenment ideals, had simply had enough. So what did they do when their demand for voting by head was rejected? They walked out of the official Estates General meeting hall. They found the nearest available large space, which happened to be the King's indoor tennis court. A tennis court? Yes. And there they took a solemn oath, the Tennis court oath, swearing not to disband until they had written a new constitution for France. That was an incredibly radical act, wasn't it? Hugely radical. By declaring themselves the national assembly, representing the sovereign nation and demanding a constitution, they were effectively challenging Louis VI's absolute authority. They were asserting popular sovereignty over royal sovereignty. And you mentioned the American influence earlier that was really present here. Oh, absolutely. The source notes that the Third Estate delegates were motivated by speakers from America, like Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson was the American ambassador to France at the time, living in Paris, hosting salons, talking to key figures. He genuinely believed the revolution of liberty that started in America would spread. And he encouraged the French reformers. So the American spark truly did jump the Atlantic and found very fertile, if volatile, ground in France. It really did. And you see that reflected in the core slogan of the French Revolution. Libert, egalite, fraternite, liberty, equality, fraternity. And especially in their foundational document, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the citizen, issued in August 1789. How did that compare to the American Declaration of Independence? It famously stated, all men are born and remain free and equal in Rights that and remain is crucial. It was a significantly more radical and universal statement than the American Declaration at the time. Right. You said the American Declaration was about being created equal, but didn't necessarily assume people would remain equal, especially with property differences. Exactly. The French Declaration explicitly stated men remain equal in rights, directly challenging inherited privilege, titles, feudal dues, the whole structure of the ancien regime based on birth. This made the French Revolution, as the source says from the very beginning, about the rights of the people rather than about property. And unlike in England, where maybe people had some sense of common law rights that had evolved slowly. Right. They were somewhat used to rights in England, even if limited in France, with its history of absolute monarchy and this rigid social structure, this concept of universal inherent rights for all citizens based on natural law was truly revolutionary and explosive. Absolutely explosive. It unleashed incredible energy and popular mobilization. And that popular will was shown in symbolic acts may be none more iconic than the storming of the bassett bastille on July 14, 1789. The bastille, yes. Militarily, it didn't accomplish that much. It was a royal fortress and prison in Paris. But by 1789, it held very few prisoners. They famously freed only about seven people, including, as a source mentions, the one priesthood that was in there. Maybe some debtors, counterfeiters. They didn't find many weapons either. So why is it so important? Why is it French Independence Day? Because it was an incredibly powerful symbol. It represented the people refusing to obey the monarch, taking direct, violent action against a hated symbol of royal tyranny and arbitrary imprisonment. It was the moment the people of Paris asserted their power on the streets and the king lost control of his capital. That's why it's celebrated. Okay. And speaking of the monarch, what happened to Louis xvi? He initially seemed to go along with the revolution, agreeing to a constitutional monarchy. He did. Bowing to popular pressure after the Bastille and other events like the Women's March on Versailles, he approved the Declaration of the Rights of Man, accepted a constitution that limited his powers. But he didn't truly buy into it, not really. He secretly resented the loss of his absolute power and conspired with his relatives, monarchs in Austria and Prussia, hoping they would invade France, suppress the revolution with their armies, and restore him to his full authority. And this betrayal came out? Yes. His attempt to flee Paris with his family in June 1791, trying to reach the Austrian border in loyalist troops, was his undoing. He was recognized near the border at Varennes, arrested, and brought back to Paris in disgrace. This destroyed any remaining trust the people had in him. So he became a prisoner? Essentially, yes. He was eventually imprisoned, formally put on trial by the new National Convention, which had declared France a republic. He was convicted of treason against the nation, then executed and executed by Guillotine in January 1793. His wife, Marie Antoinette, followed him to guillotine later that year. You mentioned this parallels the execution of Charles I in England earlier. It does. Almost a century and a half earlier, Charles I was also tried for treason, primarily over conflicts with Parliament about his authority and taxes. But in France, the execution of the King felt even more radical. It was a complete break with a thousand years of monarchy, the assertion of popular sovereignty in its most extreme violent form. It sent shockwaves across Europe. And this radicalism, fueled by both internal divisions, counter revolutionaries within France, and external threats as the monarchies of Europe declared war on revolutionary France. This spiraled into the infamous Reign of Terror. Yes, the terror. Roughly from mid-1793 to mid-1794, a group of extreme radicals called the Jacobins seized control of the government operating through the Committee of Public Safety. They met at the Jacobin Club in Paris, and our source describes them as way radical, even comparing them to AOC, plus 10% more radical in today's terms. Well, yes, they were certainly on the extreme end. Their philosophy, powerfully articulated by leaders like Maximilian Robespierre, was terrifyingly simple and brutally enforced during the Terror, which was essentially, if you are against the revolution, you are an enemy of the state and therefore you deserve to die. They believed the Revolution was constantly under threat from internal enemies. Royalists, priests, moderates, anyone suspected of lacking revolutionary fervor, and from the foreign powers invading France. So they argued, extreme measures were justified to purify the nation and save the republic. And the guillotine became the symbol of this period. It did. During the Reign of terror, approximately 40,000 people were officially executed or died in prison, often after summary trials by revolutionary tribunals. Many more were killed in suppressed revolts in the provinces. The law of suspects made it incredibly easy to be denounced, arrested, and sent to the guillotine on very flimsy accusations. Paranoia really consumed the revolutionary government. And it wasn't just a political purge, was it? It was an attempt at a total societal overhaul. Absolutely. The Jacobins, particularly the more radical factions, attempted to de Christianize France. They outlawed the clergy who wouldn't swear allegiance to the state. They instituted a new revolutionary calendar starting from year one of the Republic. They replaced religious holidays with civic festivals celebrating reason or the Supreme Being. Notre Dame Cathedral became the temple of Reason? Yes. That ancient symbol of French Catholicism was rededicated as the Temple of Reason. And at one festival, an actress dressed in the revolutionary colors of red, white and blue was reportedly worshipped as the Goddess of Reason. It was a radical attempt to replace traditional religion with a secular revolutionary ideology. But the Revolution started eating its own, didn't it? That's the tragic irony. Many of the very leaders who orchestrated the Terror were eventually consumed by it. Figures like Jean Paul Marat, the fiery journalist, was assassinated in his bath, famously depicted by the painter Jacques Louis David. Georges Danton, another key leader, was executed for being perhaps too moderate. And ultimately Robespierre himself, the incorruptible, the architect of the Terror, was overthrown in the Sirmidorian reaction in July 1794 and sent to the guillotine along with his closest allies. So while European powers like England, Austria, Prussia, Spain were at war against revolutionary France from the outside, the French government was simultaneously at war with itself, devouring its own children. This unconceivable, unforeseen consequence of the Revolution spinning out of control. The sheer brutality, the internal chaos, the constant fear. It caused many people, even those who initially supported the Revolution's ideals, to just give up on it. They craved stability. And this provides a crucial contrast with the American experience. It really does. American revolutionary leaders, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, they largely all died in their beds peacefully, having helped shape their new nation. French revolutionary leaders, in stark contrast, were often assassinated, killed by their own revolution. It's a pattern, the source notes, that would tragically repeat in many other places during this so called era of democratic revolutions. Revolutions often turn on their creators and eventually the Terror burned itself out. A more conservative group called the Directory took over, trying to restore some semblance of order and normality after the chaos. Yes, the directory ruled from 1795 to 1799. It was an attempt at a more moderate republic, but it was plagued by corruption, inefficiency and ongoing wars. It failed to provide the stability France craved. And from that chaos, that exhaustion, that yearning for stability and national glory, emerged a figure who would dominate the next phase, Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon, a figure who truly reshaped not just France, but the entire map and trajectory of Europe. The Napoleonic era began with his coup d' Etat in 1799. And he started as just a corporal, an artillery corporal, yes, from Corsica. Initially seen as an outsider, but he displayed extraordinary military genius during the revolutionary wars. Combined with incredible ambition and political acumen, he rose rapidly through the ranks to become a celebrated general. And then he saw his chance with the weak directory. Exactly. In 1799, he seized control of the Directory government in a coup, initially establishing a system called the Consulate, where he was first Consul, essentially the real power. But that wasn't enough for him. Apparently not. By 1804, consolidating his power and playing on French desire for order and glory, he crowned himself Emperor of the French. So, ironically, after a revolution that had violently overthrown a monarchy, France ended up with an emperor. Quite the journey. But his most enduring legacy wasn't necessarily military, was it? Arguably not. While his military campaigns were transformative, his major and most lasting accomplishment was perhaps legal the creation and publication of the Napoleonic Code in 1804, a new, comprehensive, unified code of laws for France. And this code's influence spread far beyond France. Hugely influential. Our source highlights that much of the world today is ruled by the Napoleonic Code or by legal systems heavily influenced by it. It replaced the confusing patchwork of old feudal laws and local customs with a rational, unified system based on Enlightenment principles. Like what principles? Equality before the law, at least for men. Protection of private property, freedom of religion, the abolition of feudalism. It became a foundational legal system for much of continental Europe as Napoleon's armies conquered it and its influence spread to Latin America, parts of the Middle east and beyond. It's a direct product of Enlightenment thinking applied systematically to law. Which leads to this fascinating ongoing debate among historians you mention. Was Napoleon fundamentally a liberator, spreading these modern Enlightenment ideals across Europe, or was he just another imperialist conqueror? That's the central paradox of Napoleon, isn't it? He himself certainly claimed he was fighting wars of liberation. He presented himself as freeing countries from the tyranny of the ancient regime, overthrowing feudal monarchs and bringing them the benefits of rational French administration and law. And did he? Was there truth to that? To some extent, yes. A key outcome of the Napoleonic era was the ultimate demise of the old feudal order throughout much of Europe. Wherever his armies went, serfdom was often abolished. Legal privileges for the nobility and clergy were dismantled. Guilds were broken up. More efficient administration was introduced. He did sweep away a lot of archaic structures. But. There's always a but. The but is, as you noted earlier, when he conquered these areas, he didn't leave them to govern themselves. They were all governed by France, either directly annexed or turned into satellite kingdoms ruled by his relatives or forced into alliances. So liberation came with French domination. Precisely. Was he genuinely spreading the revolution of liberty, or simply replacing one form of centralized control, old monarchies, with another? French imperial control, albeit dressed up in the language of liberalism. It forces us to consider that very fine, often blurry line between conquest and liberation. Especially when a powerful ideology is invoked to justify expansion and control, it really challenges those simplistic interpretations. You have to look at the complex motivations, right? Absolutely. While his armies did dismantle archaic systems and spread modern administrative practices and legal codes, it was always done under French hegemony. It often came with heavy financial burdens, indemnities, conscription for Napoleon's armies, resources extracted to fuel the French war machine. So the benefits were often secondary to French imperial interests. And did that breed resentment? Yes. Paradoxically, Napoleon's conquests often bred a new kind of nationalism against French rule. In places like Spain, Germany and Russia, people might have initially welcomed liberation from their old rulers, but they didn't necessarily want to be ruled by the French either. Okay. And despite his undeniable military genius, Napoleon eventually overreached. He made some critical strategic blunders that led to his downfall. He did. His ambition perhaps outstripped even his own abilities. The source points to his biggest mistake, the invasion of Russia in 1812. Invading Russia in the winter. Classic mistake. Well, he invaded in the summer, but got stuck there through the brutal Russian winter. His massive grand ime was decimated by the vast distances, the scorched earth tactics of the Russians, the cold, starvation and disease. He lost hundreds of thousands of men. That disaster truly marked the beginning of the end of his fall from power. It shattered the image of his invincibility. And there was another consequence of his actions you mentioned that had a huge impact far away in the Americas. Yes, his involvement in Spain. He initially formed an alliance with Spain, but eventually turned on them, occupied the country and forced the Spanish king, Ferdinand vii, to abdicate, putting his own brother Joseph on the Spanish throne. And this had unforeseen consequences for Spain's vast empire. Huge consequences. The source points out something fundamental about the nature of the Spanish empire. Traditionally, all legitimate authority flowed directly from the person of the king in Madrid. So once the legitimate king was gone, imprisoned by Napoleon, from the perspective of the colonists in Spanish America, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela, Argentina, there is no legitimate authority. The colonial governments, the creoles, had no one they recognized to pledge allegiance to. Who were they supposed to obey? Joseph Bonaparte. So they started thinking for themselves. Exactly. This vacuum of legitimate authority was the direct trigger. They argue that sovereignty reverted to the people in the absence of the king. This sparked the Spanish American wars of Independence, a whole wave of revolutions that swept through Latin America over the next decade or two, completely reshaping the continent all because Napoleon decided to put his brother on the Spanish throne. Unintended consequences on a massive scale. Wow. So Russia and Spain were key factors in his downfall. Yes. After the disaster in Russia, a coalition of European powers, Britain, Russia, Prussia, Austria, defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813. He was forced to abdicate in 1814 and was exiled to the small Mediterranean island of Elba. But he came back. He did, famously. He escaped Elba in 1815, returned to France, rallied support, and ruled again for what's called the Hundred Days. He made one last gamble to regain power, leading to Waterloo, leading to his final definitive defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in Belgium in June 1815 by a coalition army led by the Duke of Wellington and Gebhard von Plucher. And that was really the end for him. That was the end. He was exiled again, this time much further away, to the remote British island of St Helena in the South Atlantic, where he died in 1821. And with his final defeat, what happened in France and Europe? The monarchy is restored in France, with Louis viii, the brother of the executed Louis vi, placed on the throne. And the era largely concludes with the Congress of Vienna starting in 1814. Even before Waterloo, this was a major gathering of the great European powers. What was their goal? To put Europe back together after decades of revolutionary and Napoleonic upheaval. To restore the old monarchical order as much as possible, redraw boundaries and establish a new balance of power to prevent future conflicts on that scale. Essentially to try and return Europe to business as usual before 1789. But could they really put the genie back in the bottle? Not entirely. While the Congress of Vienna did usher in a period of relative peace and stability, for a while, the ideals unleashed by the revolutions, popular sovereignty, nationalism, liberalism, the demand for rights and constitutions, couldn't be completely erased. The seeds of future changes and conflicts in the 19th century had been sown, and the attempt to restore the ancient regime fully proved impossible in the long term. Okay, so we've covered the American and French revolutions and the Napoleonic era that followed, but now we need to turn to perhaps the most radical and arguably the most overlooked and tragically consequential revolution of this entire period. The Haitian Revolution. Yes, Heide, this was truly, as you said, a revolution for all. In a way, the others weren't. It directly challenged the very foundations, the inherent contradictions of this so called age of democratic revolutions. Tell us about the place itself. Saint Domingue, as it was called then. Saint Domingue, the French colony on the western third of the island. Of hispaniola. The eastern part was the Spanish colony of Santa Domingo Was at the time incredibly wealthy. It was often called the pearl of the antilles. Why was it so valuable? It was one of the most prosperous areas of the world. In the late 18th century, it generated enormous amounts of revenue for France, maybe accounting for as much as two thirds of France's overseas trade. Profits primarily from its incredibly lucrative sugar plantations, but also coffee, indigo, cotton, tobacco, Colonial cash, cow, Absolutely. But this immense wealth, this engine driving a significant part of the French economy, Was built on an unimaginably brutal system of slave labor, Some of the harshest conditions anywhere in the atlantic world. And the nature of slavery there was particularly harsh, wasn't it? You mentioned it was distinct from, say, north America. It was unlike seasoned slaves in north America, who might have been born into slavery over generations and subjected to a different kind of control. A huge proportion of the enslaved people on Saint Domingue Were directly from Africa. They had endured the horrors of the middle passage relatively recently, and the source suggests this made them a lot less likely to be obedient. That's the argument. They hadn't been subjected to the same long term process of acculturation or control. They retained stronger ties to their African cultures and identities, and perhaps had a more immediate memory of freedom, Making them potentially more resistant to the system they'd just been violently forced into. And the sheer scale of the demographics there is just chilling. It's staggering. On the eve of the revolution, you, had roughly 40,000 white colonists, planters, administrators, merchants, poor whites. You had about 28,000 gens de couleurs. They were free people of color, Often of mixed African and European descent. Some were actually quite wealthy, Owned plantations and slaves themselves, but they faced significant legal and social discrimination from the whites. And then you had the enslaved population, too many. A massive 500,000, maybe even more enslaved Africans. Half a million people held in bondage. So the ratio, that's more than 10 enslaved people for every free person? Roughly, yes. Maybe closer to 7 or 8 to 1 if you combine the whites and free people of color. But the enslaved vastly outnumbered the free. That overwhelming imbalance meant control had to be maintained through intense, calculated fear. Unimaginable cruelty. Brutal punishments, summary executions for the slightest infraction Were commonplace. Just to keep the system from exploding and life expectancy extremely low. The work on the sugar plantations Was literally lethal. Disease was rampant. Malnutrition was common. The source suggests most enslaved people had been on the island for only two or three years before they died. The planters Relied on a constant, massive importation of new captives from africa Just to maintain the workforce. It's just horrifying to contemplate this level of extreme oppression, this constant churn of humanity. It created this incredibly volatile environment. Exactly. And into this cauldron Seep the ideas Filtering across the atlantic from revolutionary france. Talk of liberty and equality, Fraternity, the rights of man. Those very ideas Must have resonated incredibly powerfully, While also highlighting the profound, sickening hypocrisy of the european enlightenment when applied to their brutal colonial systems. How could france declare all men free and equal While profiting immensely from the enslavement of half a million people in saint domingue? It's a stark, undeniable reminder of who was deliberately left out of those initial declarations of freedom and rights in both america and france. But then, in 1791, the impossible happened, and an unprecedented uprising began. Yes, Arguably the most radical act of the entire age of democratic revolutions. A massive, coordinated slave revolt erupted in the northern plains of Saint Domingue in August 1791, and it eventually came to be led by an extraordinary figure, A formerly enslaved man named toussaint l'. Ouverture. Tell us about him. Toussaint l' ouverture was a truly remarkable individual. He had been enslaved but gained his freedom before the revolution. He was literate, intelligent, A brilliant military strategist, and a shrewd diplomat. He managed to harness the raw power of the enslaved population's uprising, Unite disparate factions, Defeat not only the french planters, but also invading spanish and british forces who tried to take advantage of the chaos. He gained control of the colony? Effectively, yes, Through a complex series of campaigns and political maneuvering. By the early 1800s, Toussaint was the de facto ruler of saint domingue, and upon taking control, his government issued a constitution for the colony in 1801 that did something incredible. What was that? It abolished slavery forever and declared, remarkably, equality of citizenships for all residents, Regardless of race or color. Black, white, mixed race, all were citizens. This makes the haitian revolution Truly unique and groundbreaking in its time. So this wasn't just another revolution Seeking national independence From a colonial power like the american one. No, it was far more fundamental. It was, as the source states, the only successful slave revolution in history, the only time enslaved people themselves rose up, Overthrew the system of slavery through force of arms and established their own state. And, crucially, the only revolution that results In a guarantee of racial equality for all citizens. That's the key distinction that did not happen in the American Revolution, which tragically enshrined slavery in its constitution and society for nearly another century. Nor did it fully happen in the French Revolution, which, despite its universal rhetoric, waffled on colonial slavery, abolished it. Then Napoleon tried to bring it back. So Haiti's immediate radical distinction was its commitment to ending slavery and establishing racial equality from the outset. It really forces us to confront what liberty truly meant if it wasn't extended to everyone. Absolutely. The implications were massive and terrifying to the slaveholding powers of the time. And Napoleon, you mentioned, tried to reverse this. He did. In 1802, Napoleon, then first consul, and trying to restore French authority and profits, sent a massive expeditionary force, led by his brother in law, Charles Leclerc, to Saint Domingue. Their mission was to depose Toussaint, restore French colonial control, and crucially, reinstitute slavery. What happened? Initially, they had some success. Toussaint was tricked, captured, and detorted to France, where he died at a prison cell in the Alps. A tragic end for him. But the remaining Haitian leaders, like Jean Jacques Dessalines, continued the fight fiercely. And the French sources were decimated by yellow fever, which the Haitians had more immunity to. So the French were defeated. Decisively defeated. Leclerc himself died of yellow fever. The remnants of the French army withdrew in late 1803, and on January 1, 1804, Dessleines declared the independent Republic of Haiti. Choosing the indigenous Taino name for the land, Haiti became the first free black republic in the world and the second independent nation in the Americas after the United States. An incredible achievement. They won their freedom, they defeated Napoleon's army, they established an independent nation founded on universal liberty. But at what cost? Ah, the cost. Haiti's unprecedented success, its radical embrace of universal liberty and racial equality, was met with severe punitive international punishment, isolation, and economic strangulation that led to long term devastation that tragically persists to this very day. So despite achieving independence, other nations didn't recognize them for decades. No, none of the other major countries actually recognize Haiti as an independent country. The United States itself, born from revolution, refused to grant diplomatic recognition until 1862, during the American Civil War, largely out of deference to southern slave holding interests. And Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson, ironically, as president, imposed a crippling economic embargo against the new nation of Haiti. Trade was cut off. Why? Why such global opposition? Why did these major powers, the British, the French, who were just defeated, the Spanish, the Americans, why did they all essentially gang up on Haiti? The answer is chillingly pragmatic and Reveals the deep seated hypocrisy and racism of the era. They didn't want a successful slave revolt anywhere. They feared it would serve as a dangerous inspiration, A beacon of hope for the millions of enslaved people in their own vast colonial holdings in the american south, the british caribbean, French martinique, In guadeloupe, Spanish cuba, Portuguese brazil. They were afraid the example would spread. Exactly. Afraid that slaves elsewhere Would see haiti and think they did it. Maybe we can, too, and rise up and demand their own freedom. The fear of slave rebellion, of losing control over their immensely profitable colonies, and the underlying fear of black equality Absolutely trumped any abstract commitment to the ideals of liberty they might have espoused elsewhere. It was a clear, brutal message to enslaved populations everywhere. Your freedom is not universal, and its pursuit will be met with severe repercussions. Haiti was made an example of, and the economic punishment, it wasn't just isolation, was it? There's the infamous french indemnity. Ah, the indemnity. This is truly one of the most crippling and unjust acts in modern history. In 1825, France, the former colonial power that haiti had defeated, finally offered diplomatic recognition, but only on one condition, which was that haiti agreed to pay France 150 million gold francs, an absolutely astronomical sum, as reparations. Not reparations to the formerly enslaved for centuries of stolen labor and unimaginable suffering? No. Reparations to the former french slaveholders and planters for the loss of their property. Property? The people they had enslaved. Precisely. Reparations for losing their slaves in their plantations. It was a staggering demand, Equivalent to, as the source estimates, Something like five times their annual income as a nation at the time. It was basically punishment, wasn't it? Punishment for daring to be free? Absolutely. It was effectively punishment for their unwillingness to remain under the yoke of slavery. And it was a direct, calculated effort to economically cripple the nascent nation to ensure it could never truly prosper or become a rival. And haiti actually agreed to pay this? Under the threat of french warships blockading their ports and desperate for international recognition and trade. They felt they had little choice, but they couldn't possibly pay it outright. So how did they manage? They were forced to take out enormous high interest loans from french and other foreign banks Just to make the installment payments to the french government. This indemnity, later reduced slightly, but still massive, Hung over haiti like a crushing weight for over a century. They didn't finish paying it off, including the interest on the loans, until 1947. 1947. That's unbelievable. It took 122 years. 122 years. Think about the impact. The vast majority of Haiti's national budget, year after year, decade after decade, went directly to servicing this debt imposed by their former enslavers, leaving precious little for everything else a developing nation needs. The source points out this directly led to the education system, public infrastructures, and healthcare remaining chronically underdeveloped. Furthermore, to generate the cash needed to pay the debt, Haiti's most fertile agricultural land was relentlessly depleted to grow cash crops like sugar and coffee for export that paid for the debt but couldn't feed the country's own population. Deforestation became rampant. It just makes you fundamentally rethink that casual observation you sometimes hear about Haiti being the poorest country in the Americas. It wasn't just bad luck or mismanagement, was it? Not at all. As the source powerfully asks, and I think it's a question that should make us all pause. It's a self fulfilling prophecy to say that Haiti is poor. Not why are they poor? But why aren't you? Yeah. Meaning why aren't other formerly colonized nations perhaps as poor? It forces a critical examination, doesn't it, of how colonial powers, through deliberate political isolation and a severe lack of what we might call economic justice, actively maintained global power dynamics. They directly contributed to Haiti's devastating long term poverty, even after Haiti had achieved its hard won freedom through its own efforts. It's a powerful, tragic counternarrative to any simplistic idea of inevitable universal progress stemming from this era of revolutions. The cost of Haiti's freedom, a freedom that truly embodied the era's highest ideals, was borne not by the former colonizers who profited from slavery, but almost entirely by the formerly enslaved and their descendants for generations upon generations. And that brings us right to the heart of our deep dive today, reconsidering this whole period, this age of democratic revolutions itself. Because the traditional Western view often paints this era as this inevitable, almost triumphant rise of democracy. That term, democratic revolutions, it's frequently used, sometimes almost euphemistically, especially in western history books, to depict an age of the rise of democracy, of the spread of liberty with an exclamation point, you know. Yeah. And this narrative often aligns perfectly with that broader Enlightenment meta narrative, the big story of inevitable human progress and liberation through the steady advancements of science, technology and education. It frames history as this nice linear march towards a more enlightened democratic future, with the west leading the way. But the historical reality, as we've really dug into Today, with these three examples, is just much more messy. It's complicated. Much more messy. If we apply what the source kind of cheekily calls a Reagan measure, you know, from his famous debate question, are you better off than you were four years ago? If we ask, were these countries generally better off after the revolution than they were before, the answer is far from uniform. And in many cases it's profoundly grim. So let's apply that measure. Haiti, Haiti. Well, they achieved the profound, invaluable good of freedom from chattel slavery, which is immense. But were they better off economically or in terms of long term stability and development? Yes. Demonstrably, no. Largely due to that international punishment and the indemnity we just discussed. France. France. Highly debatable, yes. Crucial. Civil rights were eventually gained. The ancient regime with its feudal privileges was dismantled for good, but at the staggering cost of the internal chaos. The reign of terror, mass executions, decades of instability, devastating wars across Europe, and eventually ending up with an emperor. Was the average French person better off in 1815 than in 1788? It's really hard to say definitively, yes. And America? Yeah. Yes. Despite the profound hypocrisy of slavery continuing for the dominant group, white colonists, they were certainly better off politically and economically. After the revolution, they established a stable, growing republic, albeit one built on compromised ideals. So this incredibly uneven outcome really complicates that neat narrative of universal progress, doesn't it? It highlights that the promise of revolution often varied wildly in its delivery, depending on who you were and where you were. Absolutely. And it gets even starker when you look beyond these three main examples. The United States is often held up as the success story, the model. Right. But many, perhaps most other revolutions inspired by these ideals. During this broader period, particularly in Latin America, which we touched on with Napoleon's impact on Spain, they didn't lead to stable, lasting democracies, at least not for a very long time. What happened there instead? The source points out that really, the only country that had a revolution in this period that ends up with anything even remotely resembling democracy was the United States. Almost every other country that experienced major upheaval, particularly in Spanish America, quote, essentially descends into decades of civil war, fragmentation and political instability. So not democracy, but chaos. Chaos followed often by authoritarianism. While some of these nations eventually became democracies much later, often in the 20th century, after many struggles in the immediate aftermath of their independence wars, many of them fall under the rule of cadillos cavillos. What are they? Cadillos are typically strongmen, local warlords, often charismatic military Leaders who emerge from the independence wars with loyal troops. They seize power regionally or nationally, ruling through personal authority and force rather than through constitutional or democratic means. They effectively replaced the centralized control of the Spanish crown with a different, often less accountable form, a centralized, personalist rule. You mentioned Simon Bolivar earlier. He's often seen as this great liberator hero he is, especially from a North American or European perspective. He's revered as the George Washington of South America for liberating vast territories like Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, which is even named after him. But the source says his story is actually much more complicated than that. It is. Bolivar himself had grand dreams of a unified republican South America like a United States of South America. But his vision ultimately fragmented. Gran Colombia broke apart. He faced endless internal conflicts, betrayals, regional rivalries. He became increasingly authoritarian himself in his later years, disillusioned with the prospects for stable democracy in the region, famously saying that governing South America was like plowing the sea. His story demonstrates the immense challenges of translating revolutionary ideals into lasting democratic institutions, especially in societies with different historical contexts, deeper social divisions and weaker traditions of self government compared to the specific circumstances of the British North American colonies. So this directly challenges that comforting, almost teleological idea, the idea that history inevitably leads towards democracy as the outcome of revolution, particularly for countries outside that core Western European, North American sphere. It absolutely does. It forces us as listeners, as students of history, to think critically about the historical narratives we inherit. Whose perspective do they represent? Are they glossing over the failures, the alternative paths, the immense costs? It reminds us that democracy wasn't the guaranteed or even the most common outcome of these upheavals. Liberty and democracy weren't always synonymous or achieved together. Exactly. The age of democratic revolutions was not some uniform success story spreading light across the globe. It was a deeply complex, often contradictory capstry woven with threads of genuine liberation, yes, but also brutal oppression, stunning progress and profound, lasting tragedy. It really depends on where you look and whose story you choose to tell. Which leaves us with a final, maybe unsettling thought to ponder. If this age of democratic revolutions was truly about the spread of universal liberty, about this inevitable march of progress for all, why was its success so incredibly uneven? Why did it look so different in Philadelphia versus Paris versus Port au Prince versus Caracas? And what lingering questions does that unevenness raise about the true, often hidden cost of freedom, and about who ultimately was forced to pay that price, often for generations to come? That's the question, isn't it? The story of these revolutions isn't just about the grand declarations and the heroic figures we learn about in school. It's also about the deeply varied paths they forged, the promises kept and broken, and the long, complex shadows they cast across the centuries that follow. It really encourages us to look beyond those simplistic narratives, doesn't it? To consider the full, messy, complicated, and often tragic implications of these world changing events, especially for those who were promised liberty, but for reasons of race or geography or economics, received something far, far different in the end? Precisely. The legacy is much more complex and contested than we often acknowledge. Well, thank you for joining us on this deep dive today. We hope this exploration into the age of democratic revolutions prompts you, our listeners, to dig even deeper into the complex, interconnected legacies of these transformative moments in history, and perhaps to consider how their echoes, both positive and negative, still resonate in our world today.

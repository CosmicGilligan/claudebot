You know that Bob Marley song, Get up, stand up, stand it for your rights. It's just. It's such a powerful call, isn't it? Absolutely timeless. And it really makes you think about that core message, don't give up the fight. It just echoes, you know, through so much of history. It really does. And that fight, that struggle for liberation, is exactly what we're diving into today. Yes. Because today we're looking at one of the most, I mean, truly widespread revolutions in history, but one that sometimes gets a bit overshadowed. That's right. We're talking about a series of movements that didn't just shape a country, but an entire continent. Really profound stuff. So welcome everyone. Our mission today is a deep dive into the independence of Spanish America, focusing on that crucial period between roughly 1808 and 1824. Yeah. We're going to try and unpack this incredibly complex, multi layered story. We're talking about how something like 24 different countries eventually broke free from Spain's control after centuries. Centuries. And it's fascinating because when you think democratic revolutions, your mind probably jumps to, say, the American or French revolutions. The big ones. Yeah. Often framed as liberty with an exclamation point, that kind of thing. Right. But the Spanish American experience, while definitely a fight for liberty, it's. Well, it's messier, isn't it? The outcomes were so much more varied, more turbulent. Exactly. And I often. They didn't immediately lead to those stable liberal democracies people might expect. We're sort of putting democratic in quotes here for a reason, because these revolutions, they often got out of control, or maybe failed is too strong a word, but they certainly struggled to establish those liberal ideals right away. Precisely. And our deep dive is drawing on some really great sources, detailed historical accounts, lectures that help put it all in context. We want to get beyond just what happened to the why. That's where the real insight is. Absolutely. It's a complicated period, no doubt about it, but we'll try to make it clear and hopefully pretty engaging for you. So let's set the scene. Thinking about, say, the American colonies. There was that period of benign neglect where Britain was busy elsewhere and the colonies kind of developed their own thing. Yeah. But Spain's empire leading up to this, it was facing a different kind of decline, more systemic, maybe. Like a huge old ship just slowly taking on water. That's a good analogy. By the 18th century, Spain wasn't the dominant global power anymore. England was rising, controlling trade, while Spain had spent a lot of that incredible wealth from the Americas on what European wars. Exactly. Lots of religious wars, military campaigns that didn't always pay off. It just wasn't a sustainable model for keeping such a vast empire afloat, especially one so far away. So let's dig into that colonial structure. What were the big friction points? Well, fundamentally, it starts with the king. Absolute sovereignty. Everything flowed from the monarch in Spain. Divine right, the whole deal. Unlike, say, the British colonies, where ideas about consent to taxation were starting to bubble up, block and all that. Precisely. In the Spanish system, your rights weren't inherent, they were granted by the Crown. A very different philosophical starting point. If the king was strong, maybe things worked okay. But if he was weak, the whole system suffered. And the economy. Spanish mercantilism. That sounds pretty rigid. Oh, it was incredibly rigid. Designed purely to extract wealth and send it back to Spain. The Council of the Indies in Spain controlled everything, every aspect of trade. So not much focus on, like, developing the colonies themselves. Not really. Think about this. There was basically one big trade fleet a year from Seville to America, one loaded with Spanish goods, coming back piled high with silver, mostly silver from places like Portoji, Potosi in Peru, Zacatecas in Mexico. Yeah, and things like cochineal dye, indigo, cacao. But that single fleet sailing predictably, prime target for pirates, right? Pirates of the Caribbean stuff. Absolutely. They were slow, vulnerable, carrying immense wealth. And the inefficiency, I mean, it's staggering. You mentioned something about ordering Chinese dishes taking two years. Yeah, the Manila galleons. That trade route between Acapulco in Mexico and Manila in the Philippines was the link to Asia. So an order could go across the Atlantic, trek across Mexico, sail the Pacific, come back across the Pacific, trek across Mexico again, and then finally cross the Atlantic to Spain. Wow, that's not exactly Amazon Prime. Not even close. And critically, Spain heavily restricted trade between its own colonies. Mexico couldn't easily trade with Peru. New Granada couldn't trade with La Plata. So the wealth wasn't really circulating within the Americas. It was just being pulled out, pulled straight out. It kept the colonies fragmented, dependent, and it stifled any kind of local dynamic economic growth. And on top of this economic control, you had this really rigid social structure. Absolutely. That's maybe the biggest source of friction. You had two key groups at the top, both European, but crucially different. The Peninsulares and the Criolas. Exactly. Peninsulares, born on the Iberian Peninsula in Spain, were sent over to hold the top viceroy, archbishop, the big administrative posts, the king's direct men. Okay. And the creolos. Creolos or Creoles, Europeans, but born in America. By the 18th century they controlled a lot of the wealth, the land, the mines, the local businesses. They were the local elites. But they couldn't get those very top jobs. Nope, those were reserved for peninsulares. A deliberate policy to keep direct control from Spain. And you can imagine the resentment that caused. Oh yeah, you're wealthy, powerful locally, but you're still treated like a second class citizen by the guys just off the boat from Spain. Huge friction, constant disrespect. The peninsulars often looked down on the creoles, called them lazy, stupid, ignorant hicks, basically just for being born in America. That sounds familiar. Like the creole patriotism you saw in British North America too. That feeling of being distinct from and kind of looked down upon by the mother country. It's a very similar dynamic. This constant condescension bred a real sense of criollo identity and deep resentment towards Spain. And below these two groups it was even more structured. Right, the caste system, extremely structured. Think of a pyramid, top, peninsulares, fewest people, most power, below them, criollos, more people, economic power, less political power than the mixed race groups. Right. Mestizos, Native American and European descent, very numerous in places like Mexico, Peru, Chile and mulatto's. African and European descent, more common. Where you had large slave populations like the Caribbean coast, they filled sort of intermediate roles, artisans, small farmers, and the bottom, the largest group with the least power, Native Americans and people of African descent often facing forced labor or outright slavery. It was stark. Pure native or pure black at the bottom, white at the top. That was basically it. Was there any way to move up? Very limited. Sometimes if you were mixed race and had money, you could literally buy a certificate from the monarchy declaring you whiter, essentially buying social mobility. But mostly it was a fixed system based on birth and race. Deeply oppressive. So the empire's creaking, it's inefficient, socially divided. And then a major crisis hits, Spain itself, a huge one. 1700, the death of Charles II, the last Habsburg king of Spain. Ah, El Achizado, the bewitched one. The product of serious Habsburg inbreeding. Yeah. Historical accounts suggest he was physically deformed, maybe mentally impaired. A weak king ruling a declining empire. Everyone knew he wouldn't have an heir. And his death without an heir triggers the War of Spanish Succession, a massive European conflict. The big fear was that Philip of Anjou, who was French, part of the Bourbon family, would inherit Spain. Uniting France and Spain, that would have been a superpower. Exactly. Britain, Austria, others couldn't allow it. The war ended with a Compromise. Philip did become king of Spain, starting the Bourbon dynasty there. But crucially, the French and Spanish crowns had to remain separate. So, new dynasty, the Bourbons, and they try to fix things. They do. They inherit this empire in total disarray. The Americas were supposed to be making money, but they were actually a drain because of smuggling, bad administration, corruption. So the Bourbons decide to whip it into shape, make it profitable again. That was the goal. Centralize power, increase revenue, assert direct control. And the key strategy, the one that caused huge problems in America, was taking power away from the Criolas. Exactly. Taking power out of the hands of the criolas and putting it firmly back into the hands of peninsularis sent from Spain. Wow. So the criollos, who'd kind of gotten used to running things locally. De facto control. Yeah. They filled local councils, courts, church positions. They had influence. Suddenly, Madrid says, nope, our guys are in charge now. New taxes, tighter monopolies. Peninsularas replacing criollos everywhere. That sounds exactly like the British cracking down on their colonies after years of letting them be. It's the classic pattern. The mother country tries to reassert control, and the colonists, who've developed their own identity and power base, start chafing under the oppression. It feels like a betrayal. And there was a key figure behind these reforms. Galvez. Jose de Galvez. Yes, the visitor. The inspector general sent by the King. He toured the Americas, diagnosed the problems, and wrote the playbook for the Bourbon reforms. Ruthless but effective. Galveston, Texas, is named after. That's the one. He even had this interesting idea about using local guerrillas instead of expensive armies, though it didn't fully take off then. But his reforms definitely stirred the pot. Caused uprisings like Tupac Amaru II in Peru. So massive underlying tens. And then Napoleon enters the picture. Right. Late 1700s, early 1800s. Napoleon's tearing through Europe after the French Revolution, claiming to spread liberty, but mostly spreading his empire. And Spain makes a bad bet. A disastrous one. Yeah. The prime minister, Manuel de Godoy, allied Spain with France in 1796. He thought Napoleon had the winning hand. Which pulls Spain into Napoleon's wars directly. First, they jointly invade Portugal around 1805. 06. Spain hopes to gain territory, but then Napoleon turns on Spain itself. In 1807. Yes, French troops were already in Spain, supposedly on their way to Portugal. Napoleon just takes over. He forces the Spanish King, Charles the Fourth, to abdicate, then forces his son Ferdinand the Seventh to abdicate too. Puts his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish throne. Wow. That's the lightning bolt. That's the Catalyst. It throws the entire Spanish Empire, Spain and the Americas, into absolute chaos. And back in Spain, this causes the Peninsular War. Right. It wasn't like everyone just accepted Joseph Bonaparte. Not at all. Spain fractures. You have royalists fighting the French loyal to the exiled Ferdinand vii. You have some who support Joseph, the afrantisados. And then, crucially, you have Spanish liberals. Liberals who want to get rid of Napoleon but don't want to go back to the old absolute monarchy. Exactly. They want a constitutional monarchy, like Britain's. And this liberal group forms the Cortes de cadiz. And in 1810, the kind of emergency parliament, pretty much in the besieged city of Cadiz, and they draft the Constitution of 1812. This thing is revolutionary for Spain. It envisions a United States of Spain, each viceroyalty, New Spain, New Granada, Peru. La Plata would basically be its own country, but under a shared constitutional Spanish king with representation in the Cortez. It introduces citizenship, limits royal power. It's radical. Okay, so that's happening in Spain now. How does the news of Napoleon putting his brother on the throne hit the Americas in 1808? It triggers an immediate authority crisis. Remember, the viceroy's power comes directly from the king. His legitimacy is tied to the legitimate Spanish monarch. So if the king is now Joseph Bonaparte, a Frenchman, is he legitimate? For almost everyone in the Americas, viceroys, criollos, peninsulares, the general populace, the answer is a hard no. He's a foreign usur. Which means the viceroys suddenly have a legitimacy problem. Who do they represent exactly? Their authority dissolves overnight. It's a massive power vacuum. And just like in Spain, different groups react differently. In the Americas, liberal juntas start forming. Yes, parallel developments. Local councils or juntas spring up. Initially, many claim loyalty to the deposed King, Ferdinand VII as a way to reject Joseph Bonaparte. But they quickly become centers of local power pushing for more autonomy. But they don't take over everywhere. You mentioned regional differences, crucial differences in places like La Plata, Argentina and New Granada, Colombia, Venezuela, et cetera. These liberal juntas do manage to seize control relatively quickly. They oust the royal officials, set up their own governments. But not in New Spain, Mexico and Peru? No, Those remained royalist strongholds. The viceroys there were powerful, well entrenched, and managed to crush any early liberal movements. Why? What made Mexico and Peru different? Simple answer. Money and power. Tied to that money, New Spain and Peru were the cash cows, the silver mines, the wealthiest parts of the empire. So the elites there had more to lose. Much more. Both peninsularas and many powerful criollos in those regions were deeply Invested in the existing system, in the monarchy that guaranteed their wealth and status. They saw revolution as a threat to their entire world. So they sided with the viceroy, kept things locked down for the crown. For a while, anyway. Okay, so the stage is set. The crisis is unfolding differently in different places. Let's zoom in on South America now and the big names associated with independence there. Right. The liberators. Starting in the south. Buenos Aires in La Plata was really the hub of early opposition. Their liberal junta took power in 1810 and held it. And that's where Jose de San Martin comes in. Yes. San Martin, an incredibly capable military man, actually trained in the Spanish army. He was initially tasked with secur la Plata for the new government, which he did. But he had bigger plans, aiming for Peru. Much bigger. He realized that as long as Peru remained a Spanish stronghold, nowhere in South America was truly safe. But liberating Peru meant crossing the Andes, which is just an epic feat. You see paintings of it. Looks impossible. Almost was leading an army, cavalry, cannons, thousands of men over those massive freezing peaks. It's legendary. An incredible logistical and military achievement. Around 5,000 soldiers, 10,000 mules. Battling altitude, weather, secrecy. What was his strategy? He couldn't just march straight into heavily defended Peru. No. Very clever strategy. Invade weaker Chile first, liberate it, secure it as a base, then launch an invasion of Peru by sea. And it worked brilliantly. He defeated the royalists in Chile at Chacabuco and Maipu, installed Higgins as leader there. Then in 1820, he sailed north and invaded Peru, taking Lima. In 1821, he became the protector of Peru. But the royalists weren't totally defeated yet. No, they still held out in the highlands. San Martin needed help to finish the job. Which leads to that mysterious meeting. Guayaquil, 1822. San Martin meets Simone Bolivar, the northern leader. And nobody knows what they said. It's one of history's great unknowns. A private meeting, was it? Strategy, politics, a clash of personalities? We just don't know. But we know the outcome. We do. San Martin resigns his command in Peru almost immediately afterwards, leaves Bolivar in charge of the final push and goes into exile in Europe. Essentially vanishes from the scene, leaving Bolivar to take the reign. So let's talk about Bolivar. Simon Bolivar, el libertador, leading the fight in the north. Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador. More charismatic, maybe more ideologically driven than San Martin. But he had a tough time initially. Not really a lot of luck until after 1820, he said. Yeah, lots of defeats. Forced into exile multiple times, the royalists were strong in Places like Venezuela. But then events back in Spain gave him a huge boost. This is Ferdinand VII getting restored in 1814 after Napoleon's defeat. Exactly. Royalists in America are thrilled initially. But then Ferdinand VII does something crucial. He cancels the liberal 1812 constitution, throws it out, completely dissolves the Cortes, wants to rule as an absolute monarch, just like the old days. How did that go down in the Americas? It split people dramatically. The hardcore royalists, the conservatives in Peru and Mexico, they were probably pleased. This is the king they wanted. But the liberals, the criollos in places like New Granada and La Plata, who like the Constitution, they were furious, betrayed. They felt they'd been fighting for Ferdinand and for a more liberal Spain. Now, the King himself rejected liberalism. For many, this was the final straw. There was no going back to Spain now. So the King's actions actually push more people towards full independence. Absolutely. Solidified it for many. And then came another twist from Spain in 1820, the Riego Rebellion. Right. Ferdinand the Seventh tries to send a huge army from Spain to crush the American rebellions. But the army itself, led by Colonel Riego, rebels before it even sails, demanding the 1812 Constitution back. Yes. And the King, facing revolt at home, is forced to agree. He restores the liberal constitution he hates. And that was the turning point for independence. That was arguably the turning point continent wide. Why? Because now the staunchest royalists in America, the Peninsulares, the conservative criolas, suddenly found themselves fighting for a liberal monarchy. Something they didn't believe in. Exactly. They lost faith. Their motivation crumbled. Supplies from Spain dried up. The Royalist HA's just collapsed internally, creating the opening for Bolivar. A perfect opening. With the royalists demoralized and divided, Bolivar could finally mop up. Decisive victories followed quickly. 1821, he liberates Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Panama, founds Gran Colombia. Yes, his dream of a unified northern South America, though it wouldn't last. Then, after San Martin left, Bolivar's forces, particularly under his brilliant General Sucre, secured the final victory in Peru at the Battle of Ayacucho in 1824. So by 1824, all of Spanish South America is independent. Theoretically, yes. All independent, mostly with nominally liberal governments in place. And Bolivar is hailed as El Libertador. Bolivia is even named after him. St Martin, despite his crucial role, fades into the background somewhat. History remembers the finisher, I guess. Now, you mentioned Brazil had a unique path because it was Portuguese, not Spanish. Right? That old papal line dividing the world. And Brazil's story is wild. When Napoleon invaded Portugal in 1807, the British Navy evacuated the Portuguese royal family. The entire court sailed them off to Rio de Janeiro. So get this, Brazil. The colony suddenly becomes the center of the Portuguese Empire. The colony becomes the metropolis and Portugal becomes the colony, Effectively, yeah. While under French occupation. A total historical reversal. So Brazil didn't have those same violent wars. When the king eventually went back to Portugal, he left his son Pedro in charge. And Pedro declares independence. Pretty smoothly. Yeah. In 1822, under pressure from Brazilians wanting to stay independent and Portugal wanting to make it a colony again, Pedro declares independence and becomes emperor. Pedro I of Brazil. Much less bloodshed, though. It established a monarchy, not a republic, initially. Okay, fascinating contrast. Now let's turn to Mexico. A very different story there. Completely different. More tumultuous. And the social dynamics were explosive because Mexico, New Spain, was the jewel of the crown. And the viceroy kept tight control initially. Exactly. The early liberal movements were crushed, but the desire for change was still simmering, especially among some creolos. Which leads to father Hidalgo. In 1810, Miguel Hidalgo y cost a criola priest in Dolores. He was part of a conspiracy. It gets discovered and he makes a split second decision. Rings the church bell. El Grito rings the bell, Calls the local peasants, mostly indigenous and mestizo, to rise up. September 16, 1810. Celebrated today as Mexico's Independence Day. Though independence was still a long way off. And this rebellion, it wasn't just criolas versus peninsulares. No, that's the crucial part. It started with a criollo leader, but it immediately became a massive uprising of the oppressed. Lower classes, indigenous people, mestizos, demanding not just independence, but land, social justice, an end to the caste system. So it became a class war, a race war, almost very much so. And that terrified the elites, both peninsulars and criollos. As white Europeans, they saw this peasant army as a threat to their entire existence. So they united to crush it. And Hidal's rebellion was put down quickly. Within about a year, Hidalgo was caught, executed. But the fighting didn't stop. It went into a guerrilla phase for 10 years, 1810-1820, led by figures like Morelos, another priest with a clearer republican vision than Guerrero, Guadalupe Victoria. Royalists held the cities. Rebels held the countryside. A long, bloody stalemate that devastated the country. So what finally breaks the stalemate? It's tied to that 1820 event in Spain again, isn't it? The restoration of the liberal constitution. Precisely. Enter Agostindi Turbide. He was the top royalist general, very effective at fighting the insurgents for years. But when the liberal constitution comes Back in Spain, he switches sides. He does. Like many conservatives, he didn't want to fight for this kingdom anymore, now that it was a liberal constitutional monarchy. He saw that as a threat to the traditional order in Mexico, maybe even more than independence itself. So he makes a dowel with the rebel leader Guerrero, his former enemy. An unlikely alliance. They join forces, form the army of the three guarantees, and declare independence in 1821, based on the Plan of Iguala. The three guarantees. What were they designed to bring people together? Sort of. First, religion. Catholicism remains the official religion that pleases the conservatives and the Church. Second, independence. Mexico is independent, ideally as a constitutional monarchy. Third, unity. Crucially, this meant unity between criollos and peninsulares. Unity between the white elites. Who was left out? Everyone else. The mestizos, mulattos, indigenous people, African. The very people who'd done so much of the fighting and dying since 1810. Their demands for social change were completely ignored in this elite pact. It was a unity of white people preserving their power. And that leads to the first Mexican Empire in 1821. Yes. September 27, 1821. Independence is proclaimed. Etobide marches into Mexico City. They offer the crown to King Ferdinand vii. He refuses. So he becomes Emperor Augustine the Sixth. Exactly. But his empire lasts barely a year before he's overthrown and later executed. It just shows how unstable things were from the start. So by 1824, independence is achieved across the board, more or less. But the aftermath, the national period, sounds like anything but stable. Far from it. It was an era of incredible turmoil. The common enemy, Spain, was gone. But now nobody can agree on what they have accomplished. Debates over what kind of country to build liberal democracy versus something more traditional. That was the core conflict everywhere. Liberals versus conservatives. Liberals generally wanted federalism, individual rights, maybe weakening the Church. Conservatives wanted centralism, strong church influence, preserving the old social hierarchies and privileges. And this wasn't just political debate. It was violent, constant bloodshed, civil wars, coups, instability for the next 50 years, really, throughout the Americas, fueled by these ideological divides, but also by personal ambition. Which brings us to the caudillo. The caudillo, the warlord. Often a charismatic military leader, a big landowner with his own private army. Their main goal, their own self aggrandizement. Power for power's sake. They weren't really ideological, liberal or conservative. They'd be whichever side seemed to be winning, or whichever side offered them the most power. They exploited the chaos and the weakness of the new national governments. Like Santa Ana in Mexico, the Alamo guy, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna is the classic example. President. 11 times he flipped between liberal and conservative, constantly, always for his own benefit, often plunging Mexico into deeper chaos. And all this fighting and instability, it had huge economic costs, massive economic crippling debt. These new nations were broke after the wars and they kept fighting each other. They had to borrow huge sums from foreign powers, especially Britain, creating a dead cycle, a terrible cycle. Any economic output just goes to pay off foreign debts. No money left for development, for building infrastructure, for education, political freedom. But economic dependency and the debt led to foreign intervention. Countries sending troops to collect directly. Which brings us to a great example. The Battle of Puebla. May 5, 1862. Cinco de Mayo. Which isn't Mexican Independence Day. Absolutely not. It commemorates a Mexican victory against a French invasion. France was there precisely because Mexico owed them money. It's a huge patriotic holiday in Mexico, like D Day here, celebrating resistance against foreign power. Not just, as it's sometimes created in the us, a national day of drinking. Unfortunately. Yeah. Its real historical significance often gets lost. So wrapping this up, the outcomes were just incredibly varied and often quite disappointing compared to the initial ideals. Yeah. Widespread turmoil throughout the Americas, with the notable exception perhaps of the United States, which had its own set of issues, but achieved stability sooner. The liberal ideals of the revolutions crashed against the rocks of entrenched interests, social divisions and the rise of cadillo politics. Okay. What a journey. We've gone from the decline of this massive empire, through the Bourbon reforms, the Napoleonic shock, the incredible stories of San Martin, Bolivar, Hidalgo, Iterbide, and landed in this really turbulent national period marked by civil war, cardios, debt, foreign intervention. It's a complex tapestry, but understanding it gives you, the listener, such a deeper feel for the roots of the nations in Latin America today. Right. These patterns, these struggles, they cast really long shadows. Absolutely. The quest for real self determination, for social justice, for stable governance. That fight didn't end in 1824. In many ways it was just beginning. It really makes you think. And maybe a final thought for you to ponder when you compare the outcomes in Spanish America with say, the U.S. revolution. Yeah. What does that tell us? What are the essential ingredients for a stable, lasting liberal democracy to actually emerge from revolution? Is it just about declaring independence? Or are there deeper things? Institutions, economic structures, social cohesion, maybe even cultural factors that are just as critical, Something to definitely chew on. It seems the fight for rights, real lived rights, is often a much longer, harder road than just winning the initial battle.

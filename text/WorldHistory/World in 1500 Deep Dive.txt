I see trees of green Red roses too I see them blue for me and you and I think to myself what a wonderful world I see skies of blue and clouds of white the bright blessed day the dark say good night and I think to myself what I want the colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky Are also on the faces of people going by I see friends shaking hands saying, how do you do? They're really saying, I I love you I hear babies cry I watch them grow they learn much more than I ever knew and I think to myself what a wonderful world I think to myself what a wonderful way. Did you guys like my song? I saw one. Thumbs up. What did you guys think? Was that a good song? Do you know why I played that song today? It's a nice weather. Well, actually, it is nice weather, but I played this song because we're going to try and start to think about the world in terms of, you know, its history for the last 500 years or so. And I wanted to open it up with kind of a positive note, I guess we could say. So we'll just leave it at that. Are there any questions about anything that I can help you with? Anything that you're having trouble with? I know we haven't really started doing anything yet, but if there's anything I can help you with, now would be a good time to bring that up. Anybody's got anything? Okay, so today I'm going to just do. We're going to take a little bit of a trip around the world. And what we're going to do is we're going to try and think about what did the world look like in 1500? Okay, now I'm going to start off by asking you guys to think about this for a second. And I'm going to ask you, what was the MO in 1500? What do you think was the most powerful, the wealthiest, and the most influential country in the world? United Kingdom. What year? Sorry? 1500. I would say China. China. Somebody said United Kingdom. Yeah, the United Kingdom. Going in there. Spain. Okay. Anybody else? Okay, well, here's the thing. Those of you guys who said the United Kingdom and Spain are thinking about the world in a Eurocentric fashion. And the reality is that in 1500, of all the civilizations in the world, if we were to think of all the civilizations in the world in 1500 as baseball teams, Europe would have been the Padres. Okay? Actually, last year's Padres, not this year's Padres. Right? Do you guys follow me here? Do you know why I say that? Because we like them and everything, but they kind of. They're not that great of a. They've never really won anything big. Been to the World Series twice, but we would never expect them to win the World Series. Right. And, and so far, they haven't exceeded our expectations. But, but the, the, the kind of interesting thing, the fascinating thing, really, about where we're going to start today. We look at the world in 1500, and we think about the last 500 years. The astonishing thing is that the Europeans did win the World Series, Right. Like I told you, I think on Tuesday, in 1500. By 1900, Europe ruled essentially everything in the world that was worth ruling and controlled world resources. Right. And so the first part of this class is going to be trying to figure out, well, how did that happen? We'll start to get a look at that on Monday. But before we do that, we want to take a look at again, like I said, what did the world look like in 1500? All right, so now here's the next thing. When we think about history, you always have to wonder if you're going to tell the story. You always have to wonder, where are you going to start? Right. Because history doesn't have. It's like there isn't any beginning of history that we know of. There is one, I guess, but it's not recorded. Right. So where do you start? And so it's kind of arbitrary. That's why I say toes in the river here. It's like we're putting our toes in the river at some point. Okay. Things have already happened in history, and things are going to happen after this in history. So history is kind of like a river, and we're going to choose one place to kind of jump in. And I'm going to start with something that you may have some familiarity with if you studied history in the west. And that is we're going to start with the Roman Empire. Okay. Now, you guys know the Roman Empire was a long time ago. It actually lasted for a long period of time. The Eastern Roman Empire, which is going to become later known as the Byzantine Empire, will last until 1463. So almost all the way up until the time that we are beginning our history, the Roman Empire has. Has still been in existence. All right? And so if we look at this map here, we can see that the Roman Empire is occupying this part of the Mediterranean. It's smaller than it was at its height. At its height, it was like up in here. We'll talk about why it got so small. Right. But the main thing to Keep in mind is that this. This Byzantine Empire is going to really be diminished after the 8th century, 6th century, 7th century. Sorry, 7th century. Because that's when we're going to see the rise of Islam. Okay, so we start with what we know here, the Roman Empire. But the Roman Empire will be, for all intents and purposes, gone as a going power center. Well, before we start our own class. Right. So then the question becomes, well, what was it that vanquished or overcame the Christian Empire here? And the answer is Islam. All right, so now, again, we're going to go through many of these things in a lot more detail as we go through the course. But for right now, I just want us to get a kind of a feel for the big picture. Okay? So I'm not gonna. I'll talk about Islam a little bit today. I'm not gonna. We're going to it in deeper detail later. Okay, so. So now. Well, what. What about Islam? And what happened was this area here in the 7th century was basically controlled by the. The Byzantine Empire, the Greek Christian Empire, which was the successor of the Roman Empire. And then this area here, what's called Arabia or the Arabian. I'm sorry, you're not sharing your screen. Oh, I'm so sorry. See, I'm glad you told me that. I do this all the time. All right, so let's see. All right, now, can you see it? Yes, yes. Okay, so check it out. This is my. I wanted you to see the. This is the wonderful artwork that I did to put this together. And then we went in here and we talked a little bit about the Byzantine Empire right here. Right. Just to say that it's on its way out the door. Right. Although, like I said, it will last. The city of Constantinople, which is the center of the Byzantine Empire, will remain until 1453. But then we started to talk about Islam. Notice now that we're looking at a much larger piece of the world than we were looking at when we talked about the Roman Empire. Right. And I was talking about how this area here was controlled by. Still controlled by the Christian Empire in the seventh century. And this area here was basically a group of nomadic tribes who had their own government systems, their own tribal chieftains and clans and things like that. And they were at war, Kind of not really at war, but they were. They raided each other because the resources of the Arabian peninsula were so scarce that the way that most of these tribes actually were able to survive was by taking things away from other rival tribes. Okay. And then into this kind of political Situation, I guess you could say there was a man who came to prominence. His name was Muhammad. And Muhammad started to receive these, what's what I would look, visions, I guess you could say from God. And these visions he started to write down. And what the visions were, were a way of organizing society in such a way that everybody would be equal and everybody would have enough and there would be, everybody would respect each other's dignity and things like that. We wrote all this stuff down in a book that we now know as the Quran. And the problem with it was that he started to get followers because he was really reaching out to people who were on the outside. And there were very wealthy families and they were very much against this idea of talking about equality and things like that. And so he essentially had to go into exile from Mecca. I'm sorry, he was in Mecca right here. Right. He had to go into exile and he ended up in the city of Medina where he received a lot of support from the local Jewish population. And his movement continued to grow until eventually he separated his movement away from any other religion. One of the things that's significant about Islam is that it is a monotheistic religion, meaning that they worship one God. And that puts them in the same family of religions as Judaism and Christianity. And in fact, Islamic tradition says that Islam, the Arabic people basically were descended from Abraham in the Bible, who was also the father of the, the Israelites. Right. But at any rate, the point here is that they separated themselves away from them and at that, at one point they were able to conquer or retake Mecca. Mecca was a holy city because it had the Kabbalah in it, which is a big black stone which some people claim was actually put there by Abraham. And whether that's true or not, we don't know, but it's considered to be holy by Muslims. And then what happened was that this message that Muhammad was putting forward about sharing and about equality and things like that resonated among the people of the Arabian peninsula so that they became more and more united. Right. And eventually what ended up happening was that once the Arabs peoples had become united, they were able to start to expand into other areas. Okay. So now eventually what happens is they build a, an enormous empire which is this area inside the, the purple here. Right. Which is called the Umayyad. Umayyad Empire. Right. It didn't last a long time. We'll talk about why here in just a couple minutes. Right. But what it did do was it spread the religion of Islam all the way from the Atlantic and Eventually all the way to the Pacific. So Islam will make its way into Europe. The Muslims will conquer all of Spain and much of southeastern Europe and into what we today call Russia and into India and Pakistan and into West Africa. North and West Africa basically becomes, well, I should say, I should say that Islam is a religion, but it's also a way of life. And this way of life became a very vibrant, forward looking and prosperous way of life for many people. Okay, so that's basically the area then that had been controlled by the Christian kingdom eventually falls to the Muslims. The one thing that I would have to say is that there's going to be an interregnum here between when the Muslims are first challenging the Christian empire and when it actually falls. And we'll talk about that next. Right? Any questions or comments about anything I've said so far? All right, so let's just move on then. And then what happens is in the 13th century, there is, there's a man amongst this is essentially where Mongolia is here. Right? And the Mongols under the, under Genghis Khan are able to subdue China and then they expand into the west. And in a very short period of time, Genghis Khan is able to create the largest land empire in history other than the British Empire, which we'll talk about later. Okay, so, so all of this area was under the rule of Genghis Khan. Now the thing about Genghis Khan was that he really didn't care about whether you, whatever, whatever religion you had, you could have whatever religion you wanted as long as you obeyed. Right? And one of the significant. Well, first off, you can see that the Mongol Empire actually challenges the Islamic Empire, actually defeats much of the Islamic Empire, really kind of throws the Islamic Empire into disarray and also challenges the Christian empire. But one of the kind of major consequences of the building of the Mongol Empire was the establishment of these trade routes across Asia. These trade routes are called the Silk Road. And what it did was it connected China with the, with Western Europe and the Mediterranean world. Okay. And one of the results of that is going to be that the Europeans. Now keep in mind Europe is the backwater now. They're not, they're not, they're not really up in the major leagues like everybody else, right? But they learn, the Europeans learn where all the goodies are. Right? The goodies are in China and East Asia. And so really, one of the things that you'll notice as we go through this course is that the, the history from, from essentially now until 1900 or so is Going to be the Europeans trying to figure out how they can get their hands on the goodies. Right. What do I mean when I say goodies? Okay, well the goodies are silk and gunpowder and porcelain, things like that you can get only from East Asia. Right. And they're very highly valued in Western Europe. And the Europeans want them badly. And they want them badly enough that if they could, they would just take them. And eventually that's what they do. Okay, so any questions or comments about any of this so far? No. I would really like to see you guys faces. I don't want to just see a bunch of names with blacked out or crossed out microphones. I do want to see the microphones, but I don't want to see, I do want to see your faces. So if you could turn your faces on, that would make me very happy. And you know, it's always good for the professor to be happy because he's the one that's handing out the grades. Right. Not that I would give you a bad grade just because you didn't turn your camera on, but I do want to see face. All right. Okay, so now what happens to the Mongol Empire? It's a very huge empire, but it doesn't last very long because there isn't any real established authority. Okay. The great Khan, Genghis Khan was absolute ruler over all of this territory, but he doesn't last forever. When he dies, then there's a competition for who's going to replace him. And his competition leads to the dissolution of the Mongol Empire into a number of other empires. All right, so we'll see then. That, we'll see actually more in more detail later. But what's left behind is the remnants of what was once the Mongol Empire in places like Europe and the Middle east and in Iran or Persia, just I'm India and China. Okay, questions? Comments about this? Because we're all women. Questions? Comments. I understand. Okay, good. So now let's go to. Well, let's leave it there. Let's leave it at that. This is actually what's going to happen with the, with the Mongol Empire. Eventually China will become, will re. Emerge as the great power of the world in East Asia. And what's left of the Mongol Empire will become these three empires that later will be called the Gun Power Empire, Gunpowder empires. Right. So the Mughal, the Safavid and the Ottoman Empire. Right. And the Ottoman Empire will last all the way until As I mentioned, 1450. All right, questions? Comments? Well, actually the, the Mughal Empire will last until 1857. The south of the empire ends earlier. Okay. Questions? Comments? Okay, so let's talk about some of these power centers. Ming China. All right, so now Ming China comes on the heels of Mongol rule. Okay? When, when the Mongols ruled China, it was, what they did was they, they brought their own government, but they adopted the culture of China, okay. Because the culture of China was the, the high, the height of East Asian culture. It's very much like what we would think of as maybe Greek culture or Egyptian culture, something like that, or Roman, something like that. But here in East Asia, the Chinese culture is the, is the dominant culture. And so even though China ended up being conquered by the, by the Mongols, the Mongols themselves became what they call sinicized or they became Chinese. And so the Chinese were able to keep their identity and their culture. And after the fall of Genghis Khan, after Genghis Khan is gone, the Chinese will be able to reestablish their own rule over China. And this rule is going to be a kind of a reaction to the, to the Mongol rule. It's going to be the kind of what's, what I'm looking for, the domination, I guess you could say, of Chinese culture. And it will become kind of inward looking. Okay. Now the Ming dynasty is going to last up until about the time of our beginning of our history, right around 1500 or so. And then it's going to be replaced by another group called the Manchu, right? And that's going to be a different, that's going to be a different. Again, the Manchu will also adopt Chinese culture, but it's going to be ruled by foreigners. And we'll talk more about that later. But at this point, what we want to say is that the Ming Dynasty really is closed in on itself. I will say what we need to say here is that at one point during the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, there was a curiosity for what was in the world. And they built a huge fleet of ships and sent them out looking for tributaries. What I mean by tributaries is that, I mean that people would be willing to pay tribute to the Ming Emperor in return for favors from China. And most scholars believe that these ships made it as far as East Africa. And these ships were enormous because they were able to take giraffes on, on them. Right? They, they actually brought giraffes from Africa back to China. But then China went in to some internal turmoil and it closed, they closed their, their doors to the outside world. So, so there was a moment when they, they actually conducted exploration. There's even, there's Even a. There's even a theory that the Chinese actually made it to America. But I think most. Most people, most scholars think that that's probably not true. But anyway, there was a moment when the Chinese reached out into the world, but then they. They kind of turn themselves back inward. And what we're going to see then when they start to have intercourse with the rest of the world, that is Europe, it's going to be, in terms of the Europeans not really being able to penetrate China at first. All right, so any questions or comments about that? Okay, next, these three gunpowder empires that I already mentioned, the Ottoman Empire, the Safavian Empire, and the Mughal Empire, all of them are successor states to the. To the Mongol Empire, and all of them are Muslim empires, although there's different kinds of Muslims, as you may or may not know. Right. The. Most of the Muslims in the Ottoman Empire are what we call Sunni Muslims. And the Muslims in the Safavid Empire. Well, actually, that's true also of the Mughal Empire, but in the Safavian Empire, most of the Muslims are Shiites. And the difference. The difference is theological. It has to do with who is the true successor to Muhammad. Right. The Shiites say that the only true successor to Muhammad is somebody named Ali and that he's in hiding and he's going to come back at some point. But the rest of the Muslims followed the progress of the caliphate, which eventually went out of the hands of people who were related to Muhammad. Right. So at any rate, there are different kinds of Islam, and they're not always friendly with each other. I don't know if you guys know this. You probably should, but you may not. But in. In the 20th century, there was a really bloody and destructive war between Iran and Iraq because based on this religious difference, the Shiites and the. And the Sunnis. Okay, any questions? Comments about that? One of the things that was significant about the Mughal Empire was Mughal actually is, you know, a kind of a derivation of the word Mongol. Right. One of the things that was significant about the Mughal Empire was that for. For a long time, it was a religiously tolerant empire. Okay. So that the Mughals were actually Muslims, but India is home to Muslims and Hindus and Christians and for a long period of time, and Buddhists and Sikhs and other groups as well. Right. And for a long time, there was a kind of a tolerant atmosphere between the major religious groups in the Mughal Empire because of the ruling Mughals. Right. But what ends up happening is that one of the rulers will become a hardline Muslim and he will try to enforce Islam throughout. What we see here is India, the Mughal empire, and that's going to set the stage for, again, years, centuries, really, of religious friction between especially Hindus and Muslims. And one of the kind of great ironies of history is going to be that you could not have two more different religions than Islam and Hinduism, because Islam insists that there is only one God and Hinduism has hundreds of them. Right. And so they really don't mix. But they were able to for quite a long time, as long as there was tolerance in the government. But then once that passed, then that sets the stage for some real tragedy that will occur much later. Okay, questions? Comments? Are the Uyghurs part of the Mongoloid Muslim empire? The Uyghurs are Muslims, right? They probably were. They were probably ruled by the Mongols. They. They are actually in western China. Right, right. Yeah. I don't actually know a lot about them, but I. I imagine that they are. I mean, religiously, they're Muslim, but in ethnically, their own. They're their own group. Does that make sense? Yes. Okay. So, like, for example, when we say Islam, people in West Africa are Islamic and people in Malaysia are Islamic, but they're not the same people. They're not the same ethnic groups. You follow what I'm saying? Make sense. Questions? Comments? Okay. All right, so let's move on in, figure out how to do this better. All right, let's talk about West Africa. We're going to do a lecture on West Africa next week. Right. But there were three. You guys may. May or may not know this. I don't know how much you guys know. Does anybody. How much do you guys know about African history? You guys know about African history? Yes or no? A little bit. Did you learn something about it? Did you learn something? Because, you know, it's interesting that when I was growing up, we learned nothing about African history because the general consensus was that Africa didn't have a history. It was just full of savages. Right? And so that's changed over the years, but I'm not sure it's changed a lot. So at any rate, there were three enormous, very wealthy kingdoms in West Africa going back as far as the year 1000 with the Ghana empire, which is here. What made them so wealthy was they were able to control the trade in three very important things. And here's one of the interesting things I found looking at the history of Africa is that the one thing that people are very reticent about when they talk about Africa is they don't want to talk about the slave Trade. Right. But one thing that we know is that the slave trade was important to the economy of West Africa going all the way back to the time of the Roman Empire. Okay, so, so you can see these little red lines here. These are trade routes across the Sahara Desert. When we think about the, the geography of, of, of West Africa, right? And North Africa, there's a, there's an area along the coast where people live as part of the Mediterranean world. And then there's the Sahara Desert. And the Sahara Desert, for all intents and purposes, a giant ocean. And then on the other side of this ocean, there's an area, a kind of a grass, grassy area, grassland area that's called the Sahel. And then underneath that is going to be forests. Okay, so now where we're talking about actually is known as Sub Saharan Africa, meaning below the Sahara Desert. Okay. But Sub Saharan Africa has a long history of trade relations with Europe and the Middle east through these trading routes that go across the Sahara Desert. Okay. And the ship of the Sahara Desert was the camel, Right. They were able to move large amounts of goods across the desert using camels. And the goods that made these kingdoms wealthy were gold and salt. Salt. I mean, if you go to Stater Brothers, you can buy salt for 10 cents a pound, right? But salt was very important in this age because that was the only way you could actually keep food. Right. And, you know, it was also a kind of a spice, the way we use it. But if you wanted to keep your meat or fish or something like that, the only way to do it would be to salt it. Right. So salt was very expensive, particularly in a desert environment. So we have gold and we have salt, which are both high value products. And then also slaves. Slaves were traded across the Sahara Desert. I think the figure that I read was somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 million slaves were transported across the Sahara Desert. This is over a period dating back to, you know, the early Roman Empire up until the 19th century. Okay. 15 million people. All right, questions, comments about this? All right, so Ghana then was very powerful, but it, what happened was that there were, there was these different groups who were fighting over control of the trade routes. The three main trade cities were Gao, Timbuktu and Jenna. Okay. And whoever controlled those three trade cities was able to control the trade. And whoever was able to control the trade had all the money. And when they had all the money, that gave them all the power. So the Ghana empire basically fell and was replaced by the Mali Empire. Again, we're going to talk more about this on Tuesday. So I don't want to spoil my lecture for then. But then the Mali empire falls just previous to the time of our history, which starts in 1500, and it's replaced by the Songhai empire here. Okay. Actually, the Songhai empire basically covers all this area. But the thing that we need to point out about this is that, well, first of all, even Ghana going back to the year 1000 was influenced by Islam. And Islam was the. The introduction of Islam was also the introduction of written language in this area. We didn't have a written language before Islam. And so there have been Islamic people, Muslims in West Africa going back as far as, you know, the eighth century. Okay. The thing about the rulers of most of these kingdoms, some of them would become Muslims, but they would never. They were never able to enforce the Islamic religion as a state religion because most of the people in this area followed their own religious traditions. And there was one king who actually tried to enforce Islam, but he was forced to back off because the people wouldn't go for it. At any rate, the thing about the introduction of Islam into West Africa was that West Africa then becomes a great center of learning. There's a number of universities, libraries, very, very well respected scholars who lived and worked in this area. And it's probably true that it was these scholars who informed the Europeans during the Renaissance of the classics because the Muslim scholars were able to. They were well versed in the classics like Aristotle, Plato, and the Europeans had forgotten them. Right. But at any rate, the thing that we really want to keep in mind here is that these great empires in West Africa were enormously wealthy and enormously powerful at a time when Europe was a backwater. Right. Europe was backwards. They were in what they call the Dark Ages. We'll talk about why that is later. But the Europeans were no match whatever for West Africans. But that's going to change. And again, that's going to be a big part of our story. All right, Questions, comments about this? Okay, so then let's see, where are we at here? Europe. This is Europe, about 1500. What you'll notice about Europe, here's the Ottoman Empire, right. Which we already talked about. There are a number of different kingdoms that are quite large, but these are not. We wouldn't think of these kingdoms in the same way as we would today. Right. Because if we think about, for example, I mean, none of these are kingdoms anymore. But if we think about the Kingdom of England, for example, right. Then we would think, okay, well, there's England. It's got all these People, and they all speak English and they all have a common culture and all that. Same with France and Spain and Portugal, right? But in reality, what it means is that the king of England rules all these areas, but the people don't identify as English. They identify with their local place, right? And, you know, this is really true around the world, right? That. That even though there are these big empires, there are these big kingdoms, most people, they're. The focus of their lives is on the small place where they live, right? So. So, for example, if we were to look in, say, 1500, you can't read this very well, but there's a. There's a province here called Picardy, and there's another province down here called Provence, right? And we say, oh, they're both in France, so they both must speak French, right? But the reality is that people in Picardi would be able to communicate better with people in Belgium and England than they would with people in Provence. They'd be very different. They have their own dialects, they have their own traditions. They have their own. This is true everywhere. You can really kind of see this if you look at the middle of Europe, because the middle of Europe is divided. Hundreds of principalities, right? Just little tiny states, almost like city states in a way, right? And this is the way most people live. Now, we think about, okay, now here's Europe in 1500. When you look at it, what you have to think about is that there is competition between all of these little provinces, all these little political entities, right? And then later there's going to also become religious warfare as well. So the Europeans are first off, there's periodic famines. What happens is that the weather is not great in Europe, so they don't grow much crops, and that keeps the population low. And then they have a couple years of really good crops, and then the population starts to grow, and then they go into another blight and they can't survive because they don't make enough food. So there'll be a famine and they'll die off, right? And so we have to think about the social situation with famines and the kind of military and political situation and the competition between the different princes and the popes and the bishops. Europe is basically on the back burner, right? It's. It's not something that as. I mean, I guess you could say they're not going to make it to the World Series. We look at them at the beginning of the year and say they've got no pitching, they've got no batting, they're not going anywhere. Right. But that's. They're going to surprise us. All right. Okay. Questions? Comments? All right, last thing we're going to talk about the Americas here. Now, the Americas, we have to say this, okay, that we do see centers of civilization in the Americas in 1500. But these civilizations are essentially on the level as, say, third millennium B.C. mesopotamia. Right. They're very far deficient in technology than the rest of the world. Okay. And one of the reasons why is that they're completely separated from the rest of the world. And we'll talk more about this later. Right, but the main thing is to say that even though there are empires here, we call them empires, they were not really on par with, say, anything in. In Africa or in India or Asia or even Europe, as we'll see. All right. Okay. So now the two main. Looking at here are the Aztecs and the Inca. Okay, you guys see where I'm pointing, right? These are the Aztecs here. And this is. This area here is a lot of times people call it the Mayan Empire. There never was an ember. Okay. What happened was that There were like 52 different cities in this area which all. They all spoke similar dialects, the Mayan language, we call it. Right. But they were all in competition with each other. So they were constantly at war, each other, and there wasn't one single ruler of this whole area. So when we say this map actually does it well by saying that this is my cultural area, but it's not an empire. Okay, Questions? Comments? All right, so now let's take a look. Then the Aztec Empire. And again, we're going to go through this later, so I'm not going to do a lot today, but the Aztec Empire, the first thing we have to know is there weren't any Aztecs. Right. The word Aztecs, the label Aztecs comes from a 9th century German explorer named Xander von Humboldt, who. Who said. Because the group of people that lived here said that they came from Aztlan, which we don't actually know where that was. Right. But they said they came from Aztlan. Then they must be Azteca. Right? So they became aztecs in the 19th century when the Europeans arrived. They called themselves Mexica. Right? That's where we get the word Mexico. All right? But now what's interesting about that is you can kind of see it here, right? When we think of an empire, we think of like, the Roman Empire. And the Roman Empire at its height, what they did was they built a big wall around it. And they said everything on this side of the wall is the Roman Empire, and everything on that side of the wall is not the Roman Empire. Right. So it was an empire territory. But the. The Aztec Empire wasn't an empire of territory. What it was was a. A kind of a domination of a number of independent city states. About 700. There were, like, about 700 different city states here. And what they all had in common was that they spoke dialects of the Nahua language. Nahuatl. Okay. And when the Aztecs or the Mexica established control over these city states, their idea wasn't that they wanted to rule the city states or control the territory. What they wanted was money, tribute. Okay. So they would go to these different city states and they'd say, okay, we want you to pay up. And if they decided to pay up, then that was cool. They could do whatever they wanted to as long as they paid up. If they didn't pay up, then the Aztecs would conquer them and they'd still end up having to pay up. But the Aztecs were not interested in establishing an Aztec culture, an Aztec rule, or any of that sort of thing. So what we really see happening is by the time we get to 1500, this area is all dominated by the Mexica. But the Mexica are not. They don't have a great control over the area, and they're hated by most of the people that live in the area because all they are is tax collectors. And you guys know that we don't like tax collectors. Right. Okay. So that's. The Mexica and the Inca were a little bit different. What happened with the Inca was that they started. Actually, they were a lot different. Sorry. They started. They started to expand in this area, but unlike the Aztecs, when they expanded into a new area, they would take the people from the area they had expanded into and move them closer to the center, and then they would take people that were in the center and move them into the newly conquered area. And what that did was it built a cultural. A cultural. What's the word I'm looking for? A cultural. They were all the same culture. Sorry about that. I know there's a word for it, but I can't remember right now. Okay. They basically built an Inca culture, so everybody was enculturated. So unlike in the Aztec empire, when the. When the Spanish came along and they said, okay, we're going to help you defeat the Mexica, everybody's on board with that. A lot of them were right. But when the Spanish came to the Andes, to the Inca empire, all of the Inca were you had to, you had to conquer them all because they were all under the rule of one single man, the iron rule of one single man. All right, and again, we'll talk a little bit more about that later. All right, so questions, Comments about this? All right. They weren't, I guess they didn't have, like, gunpowder and the stuff that the Europeans and the rest of the world had. I'd still say they're pretty advanced with their technology that they're able to come up with. Oh, yeah. I mean, and they were, they were able to. They were able to derive the zero, and the rest of the world didn't have the zero. And they also. Or most of the world. And, and they also were a. They were also good astronomers because you had to know, you know, where the stars were for your religion, things like that. So, yeah, they had, they had an advanced technology, but it was nowhere near what the Europeans had. I'm not trying to denigrate them. I mean, the things that they built were enormous and very impressive, but it was not on the same par with the rest of the world at that time. Does that make sense? Yeah, I agree. It's kind of like the difference between San Diego and Alabama. Right? Just kidding. I'm kidding. Is anybody here from Alabama? No, I, I. Well, all right. Okay. Does that answer your question? Yeah, go ahead. It's Ryan, right? Yes, Ryan. So for the Mayan cultural area, so how logistically, how interconnected are those city states? Did they communicate much with each other? Did they trade frequently? How. Yeah, they were connected, would you say? They were. They were very connected. And also they were connected to the Aztecs. Right. These people here are called Mesoamericans, which means Middle American. Right. They were not connected with the Inca. Okay. But there was trade between the Aztecs and the Mayans, and they were very interconnected. The thing about the cities in Yucatan is that many of them had been abandoned by the time we get to 1500. There's some question about why that was. Some people say that they were never really built to be lived in. They were built as ceremonial sites. And other people say that they were lived in at one point, but because of the constant warfare between them, it was much safer to live out in the countryside. Right. So we don't know exactly the relationship between the cities, but the different groups were in contact with each other, and they did trade with each other when they weren't, you know, killing each other. So does that answer your question? Yes. Thank you. Okay. Any other questions? Didn't they, they went extinct before the Aztec, though, or they, they weren't. I mean, the people might have remained around the area, but the, the empire so say, like died before Aztecs were created. Well, yeah, let me just mention here. And then we'll have to move on. But, but there were a lot. When we. Look, when we talk about the Mexica and these groups here and the Mayans and the Inca, there were other civilizations which were much earlier. Right. So there were civilizations in this area going all the way back to about 2000 B.C. right, same here. The thing about the Mayan area is that it never was united as a single entity under a single ruler. Does that answer your question? Yeah, but there were a lot. I mean, there were some of these cities that were built long, long time ago, and they didn't even know about them until the 20th century. Right. Because they were so deep into the jungle. All right, that's a good question. Any other questions? I appreciate you guys asking questions because it means that you're paying attention. All right. Okay, let's move on a little bit. Now. This is kind of the last thing. And here's what's going to happen. We're going to. After today, we're going to start looking at other parts of the world and we're going to look at that. We're looking at West Africa on Tuesday and Thursday, and then on the following week we're looking at East Asia and then India and the Middle East. Right. And then we're going to start to talk about Europe after that. Okay. The thing that makes Europe so powerful is its so called discovery of America. Okay. And the ability to control American goods, American resources. All right. And this is. I'm going to bring. I'm going to actually talk about that a little bit today, but we're not going to be able to go deep into the story for about three weeks, just so you know. Right. So. So I'm gonna. It's kind of like I'm gonna start. I'm gonna come to the end of this episode with a cliffhanger. Right. But the, the. The next episode is still in production and it won't be out for three weeks. Right, you guys are with me. Questions, Comments? All right. Okay. So now talk about trade. And we've talked a little bit about trade already. Right. And we talked about the, the. Does anybody remember what these roads across Asia are called? Silk Road. Silk Road. Right, Silk Road. And who built them? All right, you guys are good. Very good. All right, so the Silk Road connected the Mediterranean world With China, okay? And then there was also some oversea trade that connected East Africa with China. This was controlled by Muslim traders, right? And then we already talked about the trans Saharan trade, which was mostly gold, salt, and slaves, right? And then we have this picture of European trade here. The thing about the Europeans is they really didn't have very much that anybody wanted. The biggest kind of industrial output of western Europe was woolen textiles, right? And woolen textiles were not that highly valued in many parts of the world, right? And then when we think about the year 1500, basically, trade from Europe with Asia was conducted over land. And that trade was controlled by. By Constantinople, Right? Or not constant. I'm sorry. Venice. Venice in Genoa. All right? In Italy, okay? Italians controlled the trade, okay? Now, in the 15th century, 14th century, and the 15th century, the king of Portugal, which is. Here's a better picture. That little green corner down there, that's where Portugal is, okay? And Portugal, the king of Portugal, invested in navigation technology, right? The significance of investing in navigation technology was that it finally allowed European ships to sail away from land. Okay? European ships were afraid to sail too far from land, because if they did, they would get lost. And they might not be able to find their way back, but with technology, they were able to navigate by the stars. And that meant that they could know where they were, even though they couldn't see land. You guys hear what I'm saying? And so what ends up happening is then that the Portuguese start to explore around in the Atlantic and around Africa. In the Atlantic, they run into some island. These are the Madeira islands here, the Canary islands, and the Cape Verde islands, all inhabited by white people who the Portuguese enslaved. And then they found their way around Africa and eventually were able to start trade with the coastal African kingdoms. Right. Just so we. Just so we can get this clear, there's a. I think there's this kind of idea that people have about the slave trade, is that the Europeans came to Africa, ran off into the jungle, and captured people and put them on ships and took them to America. Right? But the reality was that the Africans were far more powerful than the Europeans. And the Europeans couldn't penetrate Africa until many, many, many years later. So most of the slaves that were traded were actually captured and sold by Africans. Okay? Just keep that in mind. Right? So anyway, Africa. The Portuguese find their way around Africa. Eventually they find their way into the Indian Ocean, and they're able to connect with these Muslim trading networks that I showed you on the last map, okay? And they had part of their navigation technology was the introduction of new weapons, brass cannons. Right? And so because they had these cannons, they were able to, they had essentially a leg up on competition with the Muslims because they could literally blow them out of the water. Right. And so what happens then is that the Portuguese come to dominate the Indian Ocean trade. They establish what they call the carrying trade, which is where they carry goods from one place to another and they make a profit by doing it. It's kind of like a, kind of like a, you know, an early modern ups or something like that where they would say, for example, they would pick up, you know, maybe cotton in Calcutta and they would bring it to Java and they traded for coffee. Then they'd bring it to China and they traded for Portugal or spices, and they'd make money every time they did that. And then they would bring all the goodies back to Europe. Okay, so Portugal becomes the first of the great European trading empires. But the. So when we go back to thinking about world trade then, and we look back at this last map, right, we have the overland trade is controlled by the Italians, and then the over water trade is controlled by the Portuguese. Okay, now let's talk about Spain. Okay, let's take a look at this map here. It's not the best, but in Duke, the thing about Spain, as you guys will remember, I showed you a map earlier. They showed that Spain actually had been conquered by the Muslims, by the Islamic empire. And that happened in the year 711. They crossed the Straits of Gibraltar and they were able to conquer all of the Iberian peninsula and up into France. And then they were turned back. And from then until 1492, there was constant warfare between the Christians in Spain and the Muslims. Right? So now let's just think about some ways that we would know about this. How many of you guys have been to Balboa Park? Most of you, Right? And you know, there used to be. I'm not sure it's still there, but there was a cafe there called Cafe del Rey Moro. Right? Have you ever heard of that? What does that mean? Cafe of the Moorish king. Right. Because Spain is very, very closely tied to Islamic culture. Okay. Also the, the name Texas you've heard, maybe Matamoros, right. Or Mexico. Matamoros. What does that mean? It means more killer. Okay, Right. So at any rate, the point here is that there's this warfare that's going on. And in 1492, the last of the Moorish kingdoms in Spain, Granada falls to the Catholic kings, Ferdinand and Isabel. Right? And so the result of it was that Spain is now unified under Catholic rulers and the Moors and the Jews are expelled from the empire. The only way they could stay would be is if they decided to convert, right? And so what we have then is this very unified kingdom on the Iberian peninsula with a long period of warfare and a missionary zeal, right? And they want to get in on this world trade, okay? But as I mentioned, as we've seen, the overland trade is controlled by the Italians and the over water trade is controlled by the Portuguese. So now here comes this guy, his name is Cristobal Colon. He's actually Italian, right? But he goes, he's actually, he got this idea, he got it from an, he got it from essentially from Islamic scholars, but his idea was that you could sail west from, from Iberia and you would get to the East Indies like China and Malaysia, those places somewhere around here, right? Now, those calculations were actually wrong. And most people knew it, right? Most of the educated people in Europe knew. They not only knew that the world was round, but they knew about how big it was, right? So they knew that if you sailed out into the ocean, you could never get to Asia because you couldn't carry enough stuff with you, right? The ships wouldn't carry enough stuff, okay? So I don't have a good map here of the world. But if you think about, you try to go from China to Spain and you don't know about America, then that means that there's just disease, gigantic ocean, right? And with this gigantic ocean, you're never going to be able to get across it before you run out of goods and you just die in the middle of the ocean, right? So that's what everybody thought, except that Columbus brought this idea to the queen of Spain, Isabella, and she said, well, why not? I'm going to give you a shot, right? So she gives him three ships and she says, okay, go ahead and sail west, right? You know, let's think about it for a minute. Why was Columbus sailing west? Why was he going west? Because he thought that he could get through Asia to Asia like that, right? Why did he want to go to Asia? More efficient. He wanted money, right? He's looking for money. He's not looking to conquer anybody. He's looking for money. Okay, you guys got it. That's what motivated Columbus and also Isabella, right? So he sails out here and then he sails out into the ocean here. And on October 12, 1492, he cites land and he's convinced that he's found China because it's about where it's supposed to be. Right. Okay. So he thinks this is China, and he calls all the people here indios because he thinks he's in the East Indies. Right. But in fact, he's going to actually make four voyages to America thinking that he's found China and not being able to find the Chinese people. Right. Okay. But at any rate, what happens is that quite by accident, Columbus discovers America. You can tell because when his ship came to the island, they say it was San Salvador. Right. When a ship approached the island, all the natives on the island were jumping up and down and yelling, hooray, we've been discovered. No, I'm just kidding. They didn't do that. Right. But at any rate, now here's why this is so important, okay? Columbus was a total flop in terms of being able to find a way to Asia. He never found his way to Asia. Right. But what he did was he found a landscape that was filled with resources that Europeans could exploit. And when the Europeans discovered how much they could exploit these resources, that's going to, for the first time in history, make Europe incredibly wealthy. Right. And that's really what's going to change world history. All right? But we're gonna, we're gonna leave it right there for now, and we're just gonna let it go and, and come back on Tuesday and talk about West Africa. All right? Any questions or comments about any of this? What time is it? Oh, I'm. I'm all right. I did okay, I think. What do you guys think? Did I do okay? I think you did fine. All right, so that's basically it then, guys. If I. I don't think I need to call the role today. So if you guys don't have any questions, then you're free to go. I appreciate that you were here. All right, Professor. Thanks, Professor. Thank you. Have a good weekend. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Professor? Yes, sir? Is the Silk Road the ancient Silk Road? Is that now the resurrected built belt and. Belt and Road? Belt and Road. No, that's a different thing. Belt and road is actually a. It's a. It's a strategy of trying to modernize China. It's not actually a road. It's a strategy. Right, but the Silk Road is still there. Ah, okay. All right. I was, I was late for, for the intro. Did I miss the attendance? I'm not taking attendance today. Why not? Okay. All right. Have a great day. So you just told on yourself. I have to mark you down now? I'm just kidding. All right, you guys have a great weekend. Okay? Yeah. Bye. Bye. You got anything, Seamus? Yeah, I'm all good. Wasn't the Silk Road created before the Mongols? There was. There was. There was a road, but the thing that the Mongols actually did was it made it safe to travel. Okay. Yeah, because it was different territories. Right, Exactly. But when the Mongols controlled it, they were able. It was a safe route. It became a safe route. Okay. Yeah, it was more established. Right, Exactly. Okay, thank you. All right. Have a great weekend, man. Talk to you later.

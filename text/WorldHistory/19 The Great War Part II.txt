Same old same old school. Well, I hate to sound like your dad, but you're actually lucky that you're able to go to school. How's that? Did you like that? Yeah. You got big plans for Thanksgiving coming up? Not really. I'm just. I'm staying home, so. Yeah, me too. SA Africa unite. Cause we're moving right out of Babylon. And we're going to our Father's land. Ye. How good and how pleasant it would be before God and man. Yeah. To see the unification of all Africans. Has it been said already? Let it be done. We are the children of the. We are the children of Africa United. Cause our children wanna come. Yeah. Yeah. Africa unite. Cause we're moving right out of Babylon. And we're grooving to How I. Yeah. How good and how pleasant it would be before God and man. To see the unification of all. Raster man. Yeah. Has it been said? Ready? Let it be done. I tell you who we are under the sun. We are the children of the Rastaman. We are the children of the iron man soul. Africa united. AFRI. Africa united. Unite for the benefit of your people. Unite for it Greater than anything. Unite for the benefit of. Do you guys like my song? Yes, but I don't really get the correlation. Unless. Unless we're gonna talk a little bit like the war in Africa. Yeah, actually, you know what? If I don't tell you before we're done, remind me when we're talking about the Treaty of Versailles, okay? And then I'll tell you why I played that song today. So remind me. That's your job. I've got you down for that now. Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. Okay. How's everybody doing? You all right? Everybody? You guys are all ready for a week off? Let me just say I've gone to. I've given you something that you're going to really enjoy. Now here's something that you will really enjoy. All right, Let me just show you the screen here. Okay. Now you see the screen with the canvas page? Yes. Yes. Okay, so here's today's lecture that we're going to go through. And then I put together this morning what have been. I've been intending to do all along, which is the panel discussion project, which is the last thing that we're going to do in the class. So let me just talk briefly about that right now and then we'll go into the lecture and hopefully there will be some time left over for you guys to consult. But yeah, okay, so, so here's the. Let me just say that the idea behind this exercise is for us to look at historical events and see if they can inform us on ways to deal with current events. Okay? And so what I've done is I've come up with four different topics for the four different groups and then each one of the groups is going to do all of these things, right? So you're going to research the historical event, you're going to research the contemporary issue, compare and contrast historical, compare contemporary issues, show similarities and differences and summarize the lessons we can learn. There's going to be one written report for the whole group and also there's going to be 2015-20 minute presentation and an online discussion in person. So we'll be in class discussing together. Okay, so now the one thing I want to point out to you here is that all of these tasks have to be complete, but not everybody has to do every, every task. So it's going to be up to your groups to decide who does what in these. Okay, you guys are with me. So for example, if somebody's really good at putting together PowerPoints but not very good at presenting, then they can do the PowerPoints and somebody else who's, who's more photogenic, I guess, or whatever, more courageous can do the presenting. You see what I'm saying? Questions, comments about this. And that's especially true with reports. There's only going to be room for one report. So if somebody, somebody submits the report and somebody else submits a different report, I only get the different report. Okay, you guys are with me. So just, you have to coordinate on that. All right, Questions, Comments so far? All right, so here are the topics. 19th century immigration to the United States in a contemporary world crisis and migration. That's for group one. Group two is Germany versus Great Powers and China versus the West. That's group two. Group three is Islam and Islamism as compared and contrasted with Christianity and Christendom. And then the last one is the Spanish Inquisition. Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition and 20th century antisemitism. Okay, so there's down here I put together some little abstracts to show what I'm kind of looking for here. So the first one has to do with migration in the 19th century and today there's a lot of migration happening from the Middle east and Africa and even the Americas. And we have to look at how are the countries that are the targets of this migration, reacting to this migration, essentially where we see countries like, I believe it's Hungary who put up a fence and tried to keep them out. Right. And we want to compare that with experience, the migration in the 19th century. Why did people migrate then? Why do people migrate now? And how do people who are. How do countries that are responsive, that migration react? And then what can we learn from that? Okay, so any questions about that for you guys who are in Group one? Anybody the same groups as the last midterm? Yep, it is same groups. All right, Group two, Germany and China. Now, one of the. We're talking right now about World War I, and one of the things that led up to World War I was the rise of Germany as a great power after the middle of the 19th century and how Germany was trying to compete with the established world powers, Britain and France, and that competition led to aggression that eventually leads to World War I. Now, some scholars today will say that what's happening in China, with its rise to power in the last part of the 20th century and the first part of the 21st, is very similar to what happened with Germany, meaning that they're trying to compete on a world scale with an established power, which is the United States. Right. So what I'd like for you to do is to see if there are similarities between those two situations. And can you. Can we learn anything from that? That's the number two questions. Comments about this. The third one has to do with religion and politics. Now, we have probably all heard the words Islam and Islamism, although we don't really have a clear definition of what they are. Islam is a religion. Islamism is a political movement. What we don't often think about is that the elements that are present in Islam and Islamism have been and to a certain extent are still present in Christianity and what we called Christendom. You guys will remember at the beginning of the Middle Ages, we were talking about Christendom and the idea that all the world should be ruled by Christian law. Right? So what we want to do is see the differences between Islam and Islamism and the differences between Christianity and Christendom and how these two. How this tension between religion and politics has played out over the past. And what can we learn from that in thinking about the issue of Islamism versus Islam today? Okay. Does that make sense to you guys? I know it sounds. It sounds a little complicated, but I think that you'll find it to be a very interesting topic. All right, questions, Comments about this, and then finally, the Spanish inquisition in the 50s. You may or may not know about the Spanish Inquisition, but it was a group that was put together by the Spanish monarchy to enforced Catholic orthodoxy during the Reformation in span, sorry, in the Spanish Empire. And it became an instrument of exclusion and suppression of non Catholics, particularly Jews and Muslims in Spain. So that the Jews and Muslims were actually, as we already talked about, expelled from the Spanish empire in the 15th century. Right. And then what we want to do is to think about the motivation for that policy and compare it to the motivation of 20th century governments to exclude Jews from civic life. Okay. For example, the Jewish laws in Nazi Germany. Right. And what we want to do is we want to compare that anti Semitism in the past to the more recent anti Semitism and anti other attitudes today. Right. So there are many examples of, what should I say? Racist or ethnocentric exclusion that are not specifically supported by the government but practiced by the people in many places in the world. So that's going to be the focus of topic four. Group four. You guys are all with me. Questions, comments about any of this. Does anybody have any problem with. Well, you figure it out. Okay, so hopefully I'll be able to get done early enough today that you guys can get in groups. The problem that we have here is that we're almost out of time, right? So, so here I put the, the format for the project report, whoever's going to put that together. And then down in the bottom I've got a rubric that shows how I'm going to grade both the, the group and the individual. Okay? So, and again, there's going to be pure evaluations just like there were for the, for the midterm. Okay. Questions, comments about any of this. Now what you'll notice is on the canvas page I put the. Well, that's not what I wanted. I've put the, the document itself, a link to it. What I'm going to do is I'm going to put some other documents underneath here that will help you with things like the proper report citation format and how to find valid historical sources rather than political hacks. Right. So anyway, so, so I'm going to be adding to this. You guys should keep your eyes on it as we go on. And again, we won't meet again until a week from Tuesday. So, you know, it's up to you guys whether you want to work on this over the break or not. Just know that on the, the day that we're going to start presenting, if you look at the syllabus Here, we're going to start presenting on the 9th of December, and everybody has to be ready by then because nobody knows who's going to go first. We'll figure that out on the day of the presentations by the roll of a dice. All right. Questions? Comments? You guys are good. You understand what we're doing here? I think that in reality, it looks like a lot of work. It's not really that much work, but I do think that most students really think it's worthwhile because we learn a lot from not just about different events in history, but also about how history can be used as a guide to the present. Right. So you guys are with me. Questions, Comments about this, Any questions or comments about anything before I get started on the. On the lecture? All right, well, can you guys see my lecture? Yes. Can you guys see the Great War Part 2? Now, the first thing is I played Africa Unite as a song leading into this, which many, many of you are scratching your head saying, what does that got to do with World War I? And then you look and say, the first thing we're going to talk about is the Mexican Revolution. What does that have to do with World War I? And I'm going to show you right now. The last time that we talked about Mexico, we talked. I'm not going to try and get you guys to look it up because it takes too much time. But the last time we talked about Mexico, the thing that we were talking about was the Porfiriato, or the rule of Porfirio Diaz, which happened basically from 1876 to 1910. And we'll recall that one of the reasons we were talking about that was because of positivism as a way of modernizing a country. And again, what is the challenge of modernization? Modernize or be colonized? Modernize or be colonized. So the problem was that Mexico was backwards after decades of civil war and intervention. And so essentially, the government of Porfirio Diaz took control. And even though he pretended to follow constitutional norms, instead he really ruled as a dictator. Every four years, he had basically the Congress rubber stamp an amendment to the Constitution that allowed him to run for another four years or to rule for another four years. And he ruled under the idea that Mexico was not yet ready for democracy. Right. That the idea that the Mexican people were not yet ready to live in a modernized liberal country and that they had to be prepared for that. And that's what his group of advisors, who, if you remember, we called scientificos, were actually trying to accomplish, to modernize Mexico. The problem was that they did actually create a lot of value, industrial value, from Mexican resources. But none of that went to support Mexicans, or very little of it. Most of it went to support foreign industrialist, foreign capitalists. And the result of that, there was a lot of unrest in. In Mexico during the first decade, I guess you could say even the last decade of the 19th century, in the first decade of the 20th century. And the way that Diaz responded to that was by pan opalo, which means bread or the stick. So if you were good and you didn't complain too much, you would get bread, but if you didn't, if you did complain, you'd get the stick. Right? And this was enforced by a group known as the Rurales. Right. And so basically then, by the time we get to 1910, the group in power, the porfiristas, actually had been in power for a long time. They were all old men now. And there were many discontents among different peoples in Mexico. One of the discontents was that the liberals under Benito Juarez had dis. What should I say? Disenfranchised or taken away, basically the communal land holding of the natives and tried to make a. A middle class, an agrarian middle class. The problem was that once the peasants actually had ownership of the land, that meant that they could sell it. And they ended up selling their land to the Vegas indados and. And they had nothing. And they ended up either having to work like slaves for the asendados, or they would have to go to the cities to look for work. So there's going to be a movement, particularly in southern Mexico, led by a man named Emiliano Zapata, who are saying, we want our land back, we want the ajitos back. Right. The second group is the labor issues, which I showed you that clip about the strike in Kananea, that was just one part of this issue of labor versus the government, because the government was very much invested in helping foreign industrialists to take advantage of Mexican workers. Mexican workers were trying to organize. And keep in mind that this is not different from what was happening in the United States or in England or anywhere else where industrialization was happening. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? And then last is great power imperialism. Great powers like the French and the Germans and the Americans are taking advantage of Mexican resources to make profit for themselves. As we saw, for example, in Cananea, where Colonel Green was extracting copper from Kananea and selling it for his own profit in the United States. All right, Oops, sorry, I got excited. All right, questions? Comments about any of this? Okay, so now, in 1910, there was a lunch meeting between Porfirio Diaz and an American journalist named George Creole and Porfirio Diaz, I should say this 1910 was the centennial of Mexican Independence Day. You guys will remember I talked to you about El Grito that happened in 1910 with Miguel Hidalgo and that group. And so they celebrate that as the Independence Day, even though that wasn't when Mexico got its independence, much like how the United States celebrates July 4, even though 1776, even though it didn't become independent until 1783. Right. But what happened was that there was a great celebration in Mexico for the centennial, and many of the. Of the world were invited. Many people from around the world were invited to Mexico City to the celebration. And the problem that the porfirista government, the porfiriado, the government of Diaz had was that there was a lot of criticism among nations like Britain and the United States about the fact that they didn't really have democracy. And so what happens is that during this lunch that Porfirio Diaz is having with the American journalist, he says that he believes that Mexico is now ready for democracy and that the. The 1910 election would be an open election, unlike the elections that had been before. Right now, that statement was meant for foreign consumption and not for Mexican consumption. But a number of Mexicans, led by this guy here, Francisco Marrero, who was educated at Berkeley, took hold of that statement and started to actually build a following to run for president in 1910. And what happened was that it became obvious that the people of Mexico were hungry for democracy, and Porfirio Diaz realized that if Madero was allowed to run for president, he might win. And so what he did was he had him thrown in jail because you can't run for president if you're in jail, right? And then what happened was that Madero. And then he said, oh, well, I guess if you guys really want me to, I'll run again. Right? So he ran unopposed in 1910 and was elected again. But Madero actually escapes from prison, which was in San Luis Potosi, and he fled to Texas. And there he announces what's called the Plan de San Luis Potos. Now, a plan in Mexican history essentially is a plan for the establishment of a new government. Okay? So this is basically a declaration of rebellion, all right? And what we see happening is that there are rebellions that rise up throughout the country, not just people who support Madero, but also people who are invested in the idea of labor issues and imperialism, national control of the economy, and also Land reform. So there's uprisings throughout the country, and Diaz resigns and flees to France. And then Madero is made provisional president. And he basically called, basically forms, they hold elections, and he gets elected president of Mexico under the 1857 Constitution. Okay, just. I just wanted to show you. This is, I guess, a kind of a propaganda poster about the plan. But here's Madero's signature. And this saying, su fracio effectivo, which is effective suffrage. Which means that he ran on a platform of effective suffrage and no reelection. Basically that we're going to follow the constitution as it was written. And he tries to do that. The problem is that it doesn't really address all of the problems that are facing Mexico, particularly the problem of land reform. And so Zapata continues in rebellion in the south, and eventually Madero has him murdered. All right, questions? Comments about this? This is all going to make sense in just a few minutes, right? All right, so now what happens is then that Madero really has a hard time holding it together. And recall that the great powers have investments in Mexico, and the great powers are interested in the profits they can make from their investments, and not particularly in politics. What happens is that the ambassadors of the great powers, the British, the French, the Germans and the Americans, form a pact with this. The. The leader, the commander of the army, Victoriano Huerta, who was not only evil, but looks evil. And they form a pact which says that they're going to get rid of Madero and that Huerta will restore the Diaz regime. Not Diaz himself, but the kind of regime they had under Diaz. And the purpose of that for the Americans was. Or for the foreigners was that they could continue to do business in Mexico and make a profit without the fear of uprising. All right, you guys are with me. So what happens then is that this guy here, I didn't put a picture. Henry Lane Wilson was the American ambassador to Mexico and he endorsed this plan, Right. The result was then that the commander of the army, Huerta turns against the defenders of the nation and joins the rebels. And the president is president. Madero and his vice president are arrested and then shot while trying to escape. And Huerta again takes over. Right? But it doesn't end the revolution, because the revolution then will be divided between a number of different people. The leader of this group called the Constitucionalistas is this man here with probably the most awesome facial hair of anybody in history, right? His name is Bustiano Carranza. And he becomes the leader of the constitutionalists, who are the main opposition to Huerta. And then under him are other leaders. Alfaro Obregon and Francisco Villa. Pancho Villa, Right. And they both are constitutionalists, but Pancho Villa really is more of an opportunist. Right. He's become kind of a. A Robin Hood figure in the northern part of Mexico. And then eventually what ends up happening is that. Oh, did I. I didn't talk about the. Did I? What happens after the coup is that there's a 10 day civil war in Mexico City called La decena trajica. The 10 days, the tragic 10 days. And the outcome of that was that Huerta was back in control. Okay. So anyway, going back down here, I hope I'm not confusing you, but eventually what will happen is that there will develop conflict between Obregon and Villa. And Villa then will actually turn on the Constitutionalistas. So the Constitutionalistas then are going to be fighting the Huerta regime, but also fighting the Pancho Villa in the north. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions, Comments about this? Okay, so this is a picture of the La Decina Trajica. I don't know if I showed you this. There's rurales. These are the people that were enforcers of the, of the Diaz regime. And then as I showed you, this is Huerta Carranza, and there's Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. Okay, questions? Comments about any of this? Okay, finally. Well, guess what happens. Henry Layden Wilson, the ambassador to Mexico, was in favor of the coup, but Woodrow Wilson, who was President of the United States, was against it. And the reason why was because Madero was legitimately elected and Huerta was not. So, so Wilson views the. Views the Huerta regime as illegitimate. Okay. And he starts to look, he recalls the ambassador, and then he starts to look for ways to intervene in Mexico. And in 1914, he seizes the opportunity when a U.S. navy small boat is boarded by Mexican officers in the port of Tampico, which is on the Gulf coast, which is essentially under international law, an invasion of American soil, because the American boat was American property. And so when the Mexicans arrested the sailors on the boat, that was the same thing as invading the United States. All right? So Wilson uses that as an excuse to occupy the port city of Veracruz, which is a little bit south of Tampico. The reason why Veracruz is because it's where the Customs House is, which means it's where the government gets its money, Right? All of the money for the treasury and also goods for fighting a war and things like that all have to go through Veracruz and so what ends up happening is the Americans occupy Veracruz. That's this picture here. All right. American troops marching in Veracruz in 1914. Right. And then they actually are able to prevent Huerta from getting more money or more arms. And eventually what ends up happening is that the Huerta regime falls to Carranza. And so the American President Wilson thought, yeah, well, that's good because that means now we're buddies because we helped save Mexico. But Carranza was dead set against American intervention. He was a committed nationalist. And so when he took control of Mexico City, he basically gave Wilson a one fingered peace sign and said, get out. The Americans actually abandoned Veracruz in 1914. But what it really does is it creates a tension between the United States and Mexico. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Well, then, going further a little bit later, as I mentioned to you, Villa is going to trace the revolution and he'll be fighting using arms that he has acquired from arms dealers in the United States, particularly in New Mexico. And the American government tacitly acknowledged Villa as the true governor of Mexico, even though Beniciano Carranza by this time is in office in Mexico City. So what happens is that Villa fights a number of battles against Obregon, and it becomes obvious to the Americans that Pancho Villa isn't going to be able to win. And so they cut off the flow of arms. And in retaliation, Villa invades the United States in Columbus, New Mexico in 1916. And then in response to that, the United States will send a punitive expedition led by General Pershing, otherwise known as Blackjack Pershing, to try to capture Pancho Villa. And the result will be that there is actually a clash between the American and the Mexican army. And Wilson decided, because Carranza didn't recognize the American right to punitive expedition, and in response to that, Wilson will withdraw the expedition. And the reason for this is because he knows what's going on in Europe right now. And he knows that eventually the United States is going to have to get involved. And he doesn't want to get bogged down in a war with Mexico. All right, guys are women, so just keep that in mind. And that's where we're going to leave Mexican and American relations in 1916, 1917. Okay? Americans and Mexicans view each other with very critical eye. All right, then, just as kind of the ending of the military part of the revolution, The Constitution of 1917 is adopted and actually addresses some of the. The issues that were plaguing Mexico before the Revolution and the government that's formed basically in 1917 will last essentially until, I think, 1990. All right, so that's the pre. All right. Questions. Comments about this. Okay, so we're done with Mexico now. All right. And again, the reason why we're. We talked about Mexico was a. It's really interesting and it's very pertinent to us as Americans, but also because it feeds into some ideas that will take place in Europe as a result of the conflict between the United States and Mexico. So now we're going to change our focus and we're going to go back to the war in Europe. Okay. And remember that we talked about in the lecture about the Russian revolution, that there was a. The first revolution actually established a liberal government of Mensheviks. Now, why did the Mensheviks want to establish. Well, first off, who are the Mensheviks? Minority. The minority. That's what. That's what Menshevik means. But what did they want? How did they think they were going? Were they Communists? They had different ideologies, but they were both. The Bolsheviks are also Communists. I mean, one just wanted to wait. Both Communists, but. Right. So the Mensheviks, their idea was that in order to establish the communist reality, you had to go through the stage of liberal capitalism. Right. And the Bolsheviks, led by Lenin thought. What did they think? That you had to have a liberal government before you had communism? No, no, they thought you could go straight to communism. Right. Okay. Well, the Mensheviks establish a liberal government for the purpose of creating the conditions that Marx described. And the result of it eventually is that Russia is no longer. No longer a player, really, in World War I. They were already losing the war. Right. And then because of that, the Germans start planning for a great offensive in 1918 with the idea that once the war in Russia was over, they would be able to put so much, so many forces on the Western Front that they would be able to overcome the French and the British. Okay, The. One of the things that they did. Nobody really understands either of these two things. Right. Because they were really not smart. Okay, but one. Well, actually, that's not really true. Submarine warfare. They resumed unrestricted submarine warfare on February 1, 1917. Okay, so they resumed it. From what? Why did they stop? What does strict accountability mean? Was it because that would have originally. That would have brought the US into the war. Exactly. Wilson. After which event. After which ship sank. The thinking of the Lusitania. Yeah, the sinking of the Lusitania. Wilson warned Germany that if they continue to attack American lives and property on the high seas that the United States would be, Would enter the war. He said he was going to hold the Germans to strict accountability. Right. So they stopped submarine warfare in 1916, but they resumed it in 1917 because they, they believed that even if the United States got involved in a war in Europe, they couldn't possibly send enough troops there in time for, to make a difference in, in, on the front. Okay. So they, and, and then this was really actually effective, that submarine warfare was thinking somewhere along the lines of 25 merchant vessels a day. That was having a real, taking a real toll on Britain. And then what happens is that the German Foreign minister, Arthur Zimmerman, sends a telegram to the President of Mexico, Venustiano Carranza, and he says, look, if you join with us, you're going to get Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. If the United States declares war on us and you join with us and keep the Americans bogged down on the American continent, then when the war is over and we win, you're going to get New Mexico, Arizona and Texas. Okay? That's the, that's the, the essential thrust of the, of the, of the telegram. What I want you to notice here in this cartoon is how is Mexico portrayed with the hat? This room. Yeah, but does, do you think that they would draw a picture of Woodrow Wilson that way? No, they're like a more commoner. Right, so, so basically. Yeah, so basically the, the American attitude towards Mexico was that it was a backward place. Right. Actually, some people still think that today. Right. Not going to go there. But I just wanted to point that out to you. All right, so I'm sorry. Yeah, I don't understand the backward. Like, what does that mean? They're a third world country. Backward means they're not modernized. They're. Well, they're, they're not modernized. They're. They're more like our little brown brothers. Remember we talked about that when we talked about American imperialism, that they need to be led into democracy. They're right there, yet matured enough for, for democracy. And because they're not Anglo Saxon, they can't naturally practice democracy. Okay. That's kind of the idea. I'm not saying I believe that's true. I'm saying that's what Americans believe mostly. Right, you guys? Yeah. Okay. All right, so now, so now the Zimmerman telegram was sent in January. It was actually leaked to the American public, which created some stir. But when the German Foreign minister, Arthur Zimmerman, verified that he had sent the telegram, Americans went nuts. Americans went crazy. And they were like, how dare you threaten to steal from us what we stole from the Mexicans, fair and square. Right. And so Americans demanded that the United States go to war against Germany. And of course, a lot of it was actually. A lot of this was actually encouraged by British propaganda. I'm sorry, I'm not really with it today. I had my booster shot yesterday and I'm feeling up to par right now. But anyway, so the British were very successful at turning American opinion toward the British. Okay. In the conflict in Europe. And then recall that Wilson was also in favor of the British. Why does anybody remember Democratic. Right. Because of his missionary diploma. Diplomacy. Sorry, missionary diplomacy. Right. That the United States was on a mission. What was America's mission? Spread democracy or facilitate it? Spread and. Right, spread and defend democracy. Right. And that's going to become American foreign policy from that point on. Right. So when we saw the American troops invaders Iraq, the President of the United States said that the reason why we did that was because we were supporting democracy in Iraq. Right. And we saw American. That was President Bush. And then when we saw American bombers bomb Libya during the Obama administration, Obama said we did that because we were in defense of democracy. You guys are following me here. So Americans never get involved in foreign affairs for anything other than spreading democracy according to American ideals, I guess you could say. And Americans really believe that that's true, that Americans should be spreading democracy. Right. Okay. So we'll just leave it at that for now. All right. So now the United States declares war on April 6, 1917. It wasn't like, unanimous like it was during World War II because a lot of people thought we were going to work to defend merchant interests. And Republicans were making a lot of hay by saying that we don't want to send our kids to die for other people's profits, which would not have been something that Wilson was interested in. But there was also a lot of anti British sentiment in the United States, from Irish people, Irish descendants, to people who still did what they call waving the red flag. Waving the red flag or the bloody flag. Waving the bloody flag was remembering the revolution and how the British tried to take away our liberty. Right. And so there was a lot of anti British sentiment at the beginning of the war. But the United States does actually join the war because of the violation of the restriction or unrestricted submarine warfare and because of the Zimmerman telegram and because by now Russia was a republic. So Russia, Russia, the United States, Britain and France were all republics against Germany, Austria and the Ottoman Empire, which were all empires. Right. You guys are with me. So. So that was the Way Wilson actually looked at the war in Europe, the war in Europe was. Was a war between democracy and totalitarianism, essentially. Right. Or authoritarianism. You guys are with me. Questions? Comments? All right, so the United States starts to send troops, and the first troops get there, like about 10,000, I think 14,000 arrived by, sorry, June 1917. They don't really engage in combat until October of 1917. But by March of 1918, there were over 1 million American troops in France. And one of the reasons why this was possible was because Wilson had already started training the army before the war even began or before the American part of the war began. All right, questions, Comments about that. And then once the Americans arrived, they were. They eventually proved themselves to be very capable warriors. Right? So they actually received the, the kind of nickname, I guess you could say Teufel Hunden or Devil Dogs. And the Marine Corps will tell you that that happened during the Battle of Belleau Wood. There are others who say that it probably happened before that, but for whatever reason, that's where that, if you guys have ever heard of that before, that's where it comes from. All right, questions? Comments about this? Okay, so using democracy to go around the world and do whatever, isn't that kind of like Napoleon where he said he was spreading liberty, instead he was just taking a bunch of wind? Well, that all depends on whether you believe the United States, that the United States foreign policy is hypocritical or mentally ill. Right? Because if you believe it's hypocritical, then you say Americans show up and say, we're going to bring democracy. And by the way, we're going to take all your stuff. But what we know about American foreign policy is that there always is a strain in American life toward idealism and liberalism, starting with Jefferson. And there's also a strain in American life dealing with economics, starting with Hamilton. Right? And sometimes one is in the front and sometimes the other is in the front. So like for example, when George Bush convinced the Americans to go to war against Iraq, he said the reason for that was to. Was to save democracy. Right? And the reality is that up until that time, it wasn't clear that the Americans were in favor of that intervention, but when it came, became a question of democracy, Americans say, well, I guess if it's democracy, we should do it. Right? And that shows us that Americans really do believe in spreading democracy. Right? But remember that the reason why we invaded Iraq and not Rwanda was because Iraq has oil and Rwanda doesn't. Right. You see what I'm saying? So Americans, Americans, American foreign policy isn't as simple as we're just going to pretend like democracy so that we can get your stuff. American foreign policy is driven by really in many ways, opposing ideals. The ideal of, of creating liberty, justice, freedom and equality. And the ideal of making as money as you possibly can. Right. You see what I'm saying? So was that also the reason I know that's not joining Vietnam and Korea, was it because of the communists trying to take over, that they were protecting democracy in those areas or something? Well, Americans equated communism, we'll talk more about that later. But American communism, that was the policy of containment, right? Well, yeah, but Americans equated communism with totalitarianism. Most Americans don't realize that communism has nothing to do with government. Right. Communism is an economic idea. And what happened in the Soviet Union wasn't communism. It was forced industrialization. Right. So when the United States. It's a really long story about the way that the United States gets involved in Vietnam was mostly because of the French. It's mostly because of French imperialism. Right. And we'll talk more about that later. So just kind of hold on to that question for a couple of weeks. Okay? Questions, comments about that. I'm glad you guys are interested in all this stuff though. All right, so here we are. We're going to the last slide then, or the last set of slides. Okay, and Here we go. March 1918. The idea was that the Germans wanted to take, wanted to break the Allied lines before the Americans could be fully deployed or they've already started to be deployed. And the result of their offensive is that they were able to take quite a bit of land. But this land was not really, not really an optimum gain because it's land that nobody's really defending very hard and that it's very hard to defend. Right. So even though the Germans were able to take some territory, they didn't achieve their objective of taking Paris. All right, questions, comments about this. And just so I want you to notice this blue line here, this blue line is called the Hindenburg Line. Okay. And the, the blue line is a series of very, for the time, high tech trench works and, and bunkers that were meant to be impenetrable that was impossible for the Allies to break. Okay? So I just want you to remember that because by the time we get to the middle of 1918, the Americans had proven themselves to be capable, a capable army. And the last offensive, called the 100 days offensive, would actually break the Hindenburg line and start to mobilize toward the German frontier. By the time we get to November of 1918, the Americans have broken the Hindenburg line and they have achieved this front here and there is nothing to stop them from going further. Okay. The British army, the, sorry, the German army is in disarray. Okay, so what happens is that the German high command suggests to the German government that they should sue for peace on the basis of the 14 points. Well, we haven't talked about the 14 points. So what are the 14 points? Right. The 14 points are Wilson's ideal for the world after the war, in the war, the Great War, the World War I. There wasn't one then, but the Great War. Right. And his idea was that everybody would be happy democrats, there wouldn't be any monarchies anymore, everybody would practice free trade, everybody could have democracy. And that was basically what his 14 points were. Right, okay. So when the Germans then asked the Americans for an armistice, Wilson rejects it. He says, I'm not going to negotiate with a monarchy. And so what happens then is that the Kaiser abdicates and establish a republic, which is called the Weimar Republic, which we'll talk more about later. Right. And then that republic then asks for an armistice. And then, you guys know the rest on that. They signed an armistice essentially at six o' clock in the morning on November 11, 1918, saying that the armistice would go into effect at 11:00am on November 11, 1918. Okay. One of the, I think one of the most, I think one of the things that demonstrates how amazingly stupid this war was is that both sides continued to fight until 11:00am Right. So on the last, in the last five months, five minutes, five hours of the war, there were almost 11,000 casualties and almost 3,000 deaths. Right. So. Questions, Comments? But the war is over now. Okay? Questions, comments? Okay. Now they, they organize a conference in Versailles. Germans are there, but they're not allowed to participate. Right. And, and Wilson goes to Paris to negotiate for the United States with the idea that they were going to create a peace without victory. The idea behind that is that we're not going to treat the Germans like defeated people, we're just going to treat them like equals and we're going to give them justice and democracy and all that good stuff. Right, that's his idea. And then of course, he follows that up with this idea of the 14 points, which includes collective security, which is the League of Nations. We'll talk about it in a minute. Unrestricted free trade, which is America's standard policy since the Washington administration, and national self determination, meaning that every country should be able to determine for itself how it is governed as long as it's democracy. Right? You guys are with me. All right, so now let's think about this for a minute. He goes into this idea with the ideas of these kind of idealistic ideas, right? And he says, well, all countries should be able to choose for themselves how they're going to be governed, okay? And remember that the other participants, particularly the British and the French, are holders of enormous empires, right? And what Wilson is proposing is that the different peoples in these empires should be able to choose for themselves whether they want to be colonized or not. Right? And so little known but true is that there was a Vietnamese, actually he was a busboy at a restaurant in, in Paris. But he was very much enraptured by Wilson's idea of self determination. And he actually wrote a letter. He, he rented a suit and he wrote a letter, tried to meet Wilson with the idea of promoting Vietnamese nationalism because the Vietnamese were now governed by the French, right? And he never actually was able to meet Wilson. And Wilson probably never saw his letter. And the reason France was not about to give up Southeast Asia. And so what ended up happening was that Ho Chi Minh went to Moscow and joined the Comintern. What's the Comintern? Communist International Committee. And what's the purpose of the Comintern? What's the purpose of it? Spread communism. Exactly. You guys have heard of Ho Chi Minh before? There's a city before. I've heard of him, yeah. It used to be called Saigon. Right, sorry, it used to be called Saigon. He was actually the leader of the, what they call the Viet Minh in Vietnam, which becomes eventually the enemy of the United States. Okay, and we'll talk more about that again on a different day. Right, but what we see happening here is that the kind of the, the hard headedness of the Western powers drives this guy into the hands of the Communists, right? And so the, what happened in Vietnam was considered part of the worldwide communist progress, Right? And that's why the United States ended up being against it again. We'll talk more about it later. All right. Also, this guy here, you may or may not have heard of him, W.E.B. du Bois was an American intellectual and he was in, in Versailles with the idea of promoting Pan Africanism. What do you think Pan Africanism might be a United Africa. I'm sorry, is it a united Africa? I didn't get it. United Africa. Really what it means is that all Africans in the world should unite under one nation, right? So for example, in The United States, we saw the rise of the Nation of Islam. The idea behind the Nation of Islam is that blacks should not participate in the white economy and the white society, white politics. That they should actually practice their own economy, society and politics in league with all the other African descendants around the world. Okay, you guys follow me here. So then that might be the reason why I played that song, Africa Unite. Right? Because that is a. It's actually a component, I guess you could say, of that idea of Pan Africanism. All right, well, anyway, none of those things were actually realized. All right, so the conference at Versailles, Britain, France, United States, Italy and Japan. Oops, sorry. Wilson's idealism, as I already mentioned, clashes with ideals, with the Allies imperial aims. And the only thing that Wilson gets out of the, of the conference from his 14 points is the League of Nations. Right? You guys see this, this cartoon? You have to wonder, why did I put that cartoon there? And I'll tell you in a minute, okay? Questions, Comments about anything. I heard that, or I read a report that, that Wilson got very sick during those debates and actually lost his vigor to stick with his ideals during that time. And that's why he almost got none of what he wanted. I'm not sure about that. I haven't ever heard that. But I know that once he came back to the United States and tries to sell the League of Nations to the United States, Americans refuse to, or the American Congress essentially refuses to ratify it. And the result is that he goes on a train tour of the United States looking to promote the League of Nations. And while he's on his tour, he has a stroke and he's no longer able to continue. The United States eventually rejects the League of Nations and Wilson essentially is no longer able to rule. Some people argue that it was actually his wife who acted as president for the last. For the rest of Wilson's term. Okay. Does that answer your question? No, that's what the report was, that his health begins to decline after that. And then later on he has a stroke and he. And then obviously. Yeah, right. He had very high blood pressure. He was kind of a, a raw nerve, I guess you could say. A very stressed out man. All right. And you can imagine, I mean, if you think about. Wilson was elected as a progressive to, to handle domestic issues and he ended up having to handle all these foreign issues. And his idealism was not suited to the reality of politics at the beginning of the 20th century. World politics. Right. So you can understand why he might have been so upset. Right? But at any Rate the treaties. There's actually 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 treaties. And these are the different treaties. Versailles with Germany, Saint Germain with Austria, Hungary with Bulgaria, Trianon with Hungary and Severus with the Ottoman Empire. And then what we see here then is that the map makers at Versailles sat down and drew lines on the map and said, okay, we're going to make Czechoslovakia a country and we're going to make Yugoslavia a country and we're going to make Poland a country. It hasn't been a country in a thousand years, but now we're going to make it one. Right? And so what we see happening is that the political map of Europe reflects the ideas of the map makers at Versailles and not the reality of European politics or demography. Right? So for example, you guys may or may not know that Czechoslovakia is no longer Czechoslovakia, it's now the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, right? And you may or may not know that Yugoslavia is no longer Yugoslavia, it's now Serbia and Bosnia, Macedonia, a bunch of different countries here, right? Because the, the, the idea, the country making ideas, the nation building ideas of the, the map makers at Versailles didn't match the reality of German or of European demographics. You guys are following me here. Questions, comments about any of this. All right, so now they did this in Europe, which is going to create a lot of problems and we'll see that as we go through the rest of the course. They also did it with the Ottoman Empire. They divided the Ottoman Empire the, into these new countries, right, which were, this was, this is Jordan, this is Palestine, right? Palestine is divided between Israelis and, and Palestinians. And they create this new country here, Iraq, which if you guys will remember, the, it was, had been under the rule of the Ottoman Empire for a thousand years. And it had never been called Iraq. It had never been a country or a nation. And in fact, it was made up of three different groups of people who hated each other. The Sunnis, the Shiites and the Kurds. Okay? But they draw these lines in Versailles and say, okay, you guys are a country now. This is a kingdom. Essentially. They create this kingdom of Iraq, right? And the idea behind it is that the European powers, the British and the French, are able to take advantage of the resources that are found in these countries. Okay? So these are called mandates, they're called the French mandate and the British mandate. And the idea behind it is that we're going to actually rule or have influence over rule of these places until you guys are ready for democracy. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? But what do you think is really driving that? Do you think it's really the idea of civilization and enlightenment, or do you think it's the idea of, look, we got access to a lot of oil. What do you guys think? I just. You don't have to tell me. Just think about it. Okay. Anyway, the question here that I want to bring up, and it's. It's a modern question, right? And that is if. If we know from studying, what is it? Sophomore history or even French? Yes, I guess it's sophomore history. Right. Sophomore history in college. That Iraq was never a country before 1920. Why is it that American troops spent years in Iraq trying to maintain Iraq's nation nationalism, trying to uphold the nation of Iraq? What nation? There is no nation. There really has never been an Iraqi nation. What that question then leads to is how can it be that America's political and military leaders don't know that this is a historical creation? It's not a reality. And they. They. They spend American money and lives trying to uphold something that never existed before 1920. Right. So I think that that ought to be a good reason for us to consider that. It ought to be a motivation for us to consider that studying history actually is really important, don't you think? Because if. I would say that if you actually knew the history of this region, you would never try to use troops or money or anything else to uphold nationalism in this area. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, comments about this. Okay, so now I'm almost done here, I think. So what is the. What is the legacy of the Versailles Conference? Well, the war itself leads to massive war debts on every side and reparations in the case of Germany. And what eventually that's going to lead to, and I'll explain this to you when we come back, is worldwide depression. Right. Which is going to then lead to some cultural changes that eventually will. Will draw the world into World War II harshness. The Germans surrendered with the idea that they would receive a. What's the word I'm looking for? Lenient peace treaty. And they end up with an incredibly harsh peace treaty. They're caused to give up a lot of their territory. Some of that they had already taken from France and others that they had to give up to the Allies. The areas where they had industrial resources and they were forced to disarm. They were divided into two different countries by Poland. And that all eventually leads into this Great Depression where the people of Germany are very, very unhappy. I mean, understandably so. But here comes this guy, Adolf Hitler, and He says, well, it wouldn't be for this. It wouldn't be this way if it wasn't for the Jews. And so that's going to lead then eventually to the rise of Nazism in Germany, which we know the outcome of that, the ineffectiveness of the League of Nations encourages international adventurism. The United States doesn't join, so there really isn't any teeth behind it. And in 1935, I think, or something like that, maybe earlier, Italy invades Ethiopia and the League of Nations does nothing. And other countries are going to see that, like Japan, and say, look, we can invade anybody we want and the League of Nations won't do anything, right? And so we're going to see, you know, imperial expansion or territorial expansion on the part of Italy, Germany, Japan, mostly those countries, right? Which will eventually lead to World War II. And then the rejection of Wilson's proposals and the imperial aims of the great powers lay the basis for a continuing conflict. So, as I already mentioned to you guys, one of the things that happens is that after World War I, the world is divided up by the Allies in ways that make sense to the Allies but don't make sense to European reality or world reality. Right? So you see, for example, that the Allies will take the German holdings in Africa and turn them into nations, even though those holdings have nothing to do with African reality. And we see that again, we saw it in. We will see it in India, Pakistan. We'll see it in Southeast Asia and in Europe and in the Middle East. Right? So basically, then, what we see is that the consequences of the treaty or the Conference of Versailles are still causing conflict in the world today and have caused enormous amounts of conflict in the 20th and 21st century. And so I would have to say I believe that the Versailles Conference was one of the most cataclysmic events in world history because it caused so much disorder. And when we go and talk about Wilson and the other imperial nations, Wilson, as an idealist, could see that the world would not be able to continue in the same way that it had in the 19th century. And in that way, you could say he was kind of prophetic. Okay? But the Europeans, particularly the Europeans were not able to appreciate what Wilson saw. And so they tried to continue as if the world had not changed. And that's going to be what leads to the tragedies that follow. All right, Questions? Comments about any of this? Okay. What time is it? Okay, you guys have got 10 minutes. Sorry. You said Italy took or went after Ethiopia, but did it invade it? Because I thought Ethiopia stayed an independent nation or something. It did until the 1930s. And then Italy invaded with the idea of rebuilding the Roman Empire. Even though the Roman Empire had never been Ethiopia. It didn't matter because when you start talking about nationalism and the facts don't really matter, right? But no, it was invaded, and it ended up being a kind of a fiasco that the Italian military has not been as effective as they would like it to be since the time of the Roman Empire. So, anyway. Questions? Comments? All right, so you've got 10 minutes. I don't know if you guys want to go into groups now or just. Just split and then you guys can figure out how to get together on your own. What do you guys want? Go into groups? Can you throw us in groups? How many of you guys are in. How many of you guys are in favor of going in groups? Nobody? Well, I'll tell you what I'll do then. I will go ahead and make the groups. I think. How do I do this? And then you guys, if you want to go into them, you can. Okay, no, that's not what I want. That's not. That's not at all what I want. Okay, where do I do groups at? Breakout rooms. That's what they call it. Okay, we're going to create four. You guys know which group you're in. So there you go. They're all open now, so if I don't see you again, you guys can leave after you're done. If I don't see you guys again, have a great Thanksgiving break, and I'll look forward to seeing you when you come back. All right, thank you, Professor. I'm gonna have to go now, though, because I have work in, like. Like about 20 minutes. Okay, well, just make sure you're in touch with your group, okay? Yeah, I'll be in touch. Just make sure you're in touch with your group. Okay. All right, thank you. Have a nice. Have a nice day. Have a good one. Great. All right. YouTube. Dom, is this the same groups as the last ones? Huh? It's the same group for the midterm. Okay, Professor, I came late into the class. About 15 minutes late. The group. Is this for the finals? No, this is for the. The group project. But it's all the same group, so you guys are. You guys are going to be in the same groups throughout, but it's for the group projects this time. Okay. I didn't. I didn't see my name. I was in group three, room three. And I don't. I don't see my. Okay, it. So Austin and Diego, can you hear me? Yes, Professor. If there's nobody in there, then I guess the best way to handle the situation would be to try whatever other method you guys use for the midterm to get a hold of the rest of the group because they must not have thought it was important to stay for the. The breakout rooms. Yeah, we had. We had set up that was shared, but I guess I'll just have to message them separately. Yeah, however. However you guys get together. I'm actually kind of sad that they didn't take the opportunity to get together because we won't have another opportunity until almost two weeks from now. So, yeah, I'll do my best to message them and get linked up. All right, well, I'll check in with you guys when we come back. So, you know, I'm still available on email. If you need something, just send me an email. Gotcha. Thank you, Professor. All right, it. I had one question, Professor. Okay. I was wondering when you showed the map of Iraq, it showed Saudi Arabia. I was wondering about when you showed the map of how they split. Saudi Arabia was. So it already became a country during the time of the Ottoman and everything? Yeah, a long time ago. Saudi Arabia had been independent before. Okay, let me just see. Hold on a second. Saudi National Day is celebrated in Saudi Arabia every 23rd of September to commemorate the renaming of the kingdom of Nej to and Hejaz to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by royal decree. Well, that was in 1932, so it must have been made up by a number of other kingdoms, other groups, just like it had been in the. Oh, okay. In the past. Then it was all like. I just remember that it was all put under Saudi Arabia under like Al Saud or something. Whoever the founder was. It was. Yeah, that was. I don't know when that was, to be honest with you, but Saudi Arabia wasn't part of the Ottoman Empire. By the time we get to World War I, it had already broken away. So when they divided up, the empire is mainly just they had control of like Jerusalem and northern parts of. Right. Middle East. Okay. I didn't realize it was that much of a decline by that. That time. Oh, yeah, well, it's been there for a thousand years, so. Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you, Professor. Have a good holiday. All right. Have a good one. Happy Thanksgiving, Professor. Same to you. Have a good one. Look forward to seeing you on the way back.

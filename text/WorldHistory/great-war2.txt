Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today we're plunging into a truly pivotal period in world history, the Great War Part 2, specifically covering the tumultuous years from 1917 right through to 1921. This wasn't just the final stretch of the first global conflict. It was. Well, it was the crucible that forged the modern world, laying the groundwork for so many of the international dynamics and, frankly, conflicts we still grapple with today. We've gathered some really insightful material for you, drawing from detailed historical lectures, comprehensive research to give you a shortcut, maybe, to understanding this incredibly complex era. Our mission, really is to connect the dots between seemingly disparate events. You know, from the profound internal struggles and revolutions down in Mexico to the pivotal brutal moments on the Western Front and the lasting, often really problematic impacts of the peace treaty that followed. You'll discover how seemingly separate threads are actually intricately interwoven, shaping not just the 20th century, but, well, our world as we know it today. What's truly fascinating here is precisely that interconnectedness you mentioned. Events that might appear, you know, on the surface to be geographically and politically quite distant, like the Mexican Revolution unfolding pretty much concurrently with America's eventual entry into World War I, are actually intricately linked. They form this vast, complex mosaic of global shifts where each piece influences the others. We'll unpack not just what happened in each of these critical moments, but really why these connections matter, delving into the underlying motivations and the. Well, the profound ways they shape the geopolitical landscape that we, a century later, still navigate. I mean, we're looking at the very roots of modern international relations, global economic systems, and even many of the ongoing conflicts that dominate our headlines. Get ready for some serious aha moments, I think, because we're about to uncover just. Just how deeply intertwined these global narratives truly are. It's far more than just a historical timeline. It's about understanding the ripple effects of decisions made and forces unleashed, you know, a century ago. Okay, let's unpack this. Our Deep Dive begins, maybe surprisingly far from the muddy trenches of Europe. We're going down to Mexico with a revolution that was simmering and then erupting long before the Great War escalated into its final, most intense phase. And believe me, this isn't just a side story, something happening kind of concurrently but unrelated. No, it's absolutely crucial context for understanding America's later decisions on the world stage, especially concerning its eventual decisive entry into the European conflict. The lessons learned, or sometimes maybe unlearned down in Mexico, directly influence US Policy In Europe. Right. If we connect this to the bigger picture, Mexico's tumultuous journey during this time really embodies a core global challenge, a powerful imperative that faced many nations across the world back then. It was the stark modernize or be colonized. You see the struggle playing out in various forms, Economically, politically, culturally, across the globe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In Mexico, the struggle was really defined by the long autocratic rule of Porfiro Diaz, a period we called porfiriado, which spanned from 1876 right up to 1910. Diaz's regime was ostensibly, anyway, about bringing Mexico into the modern age, transforming it into a prosperous, recognized, global, global player. His guiding principle, touted by his intellectual advisors, the scientificos, was liberty, order, progress. These scientificos, they adhered to a philosophy called positivism. In practice, this meant applying what they considered scientific methods to social organization, to governance. They believed that order achieved through strong centralized rule was the prerequisite for progress, and that progress would then eventually allow for a measure of liberty. And look, under Diaz, there was a significant amount of economic value created. No doubt about it, There was considerable industrial development. Mining, railroads, agriculture, and foreign investment poured into Mexico for resource extraction. However, the critical flaw, the deep analysis reveals, was that this newfound wealth and apparent progress, well, it largely benefited foreign capitalists. Companies from the United States, France, Germany, they flocked to Mexico, investing heavily, exploiting its vast natural resources and, crucially, its cheap labor. This led to widespread discontent among the Mexican populace, who saw their nation's wealth basically siphoned off by outsiders, while they themselves remained largely impoverished and disenfranchised. Okay, so with this growing unrest, this sort of simmering resentment bubbling beneath the surface, what measures did Diaz actually employ to maintain his tight grip on power for what, over 30 years? He famously, or maybe infamously, adopted a policy known as panopalo. Right, which translates chillingly to bread or the stick. Exactly. And it wasn't just a saying. It was a brutally effective, albeit, you know, oppressive system of control. It was enforced by his feared rural police force, the rurales, who were often, interestingly, recruited from bandit gangs, which only added to their intimidating reputation. The message to the Mexican people was stark, unambiguous. You were either rewarded with bread, maybe economic benefits, political favors, or just simply protection from the rurales for your compliance, or you met with the stick. And the stick represented severe repression, violence, arbitrary imprisonment, even death if you dared to complain or organize or dissent against his rule. It was a stark choice that for decades, effectively stifled widespread organized opposition. But it Certainly didn't extinguish the flames of discontent. They were just waiting for a spark. Right. This bridge of the stick policy, while it maintained a kind of order for a time, it ultimately raised these profound questions about power, inequality, social justice. And by 1910, these festering discontents were really on the verge of erupting into full scale revolution. What were the main pressure points? Well, there were several key areas where this profound discontent manifested. First, and perhaps most explosively, was the issue of land reform. This was huge. Decades earlier, the liberals under Benito Juarez had tried to create an agrarian middle class. They broke up large landholders holdings, communal lands, including the traditional ejidos. However, the tragic unintended consequence was that many peasants, maybe unfamiliar with land ownership in a capitalist system or just desperate for cash, they were compelled to sell their newly acquired communal lands to wealthy haciendados. These haciendados then rapidly amassed enormous consolidated estates. This process led to widespread landlessness among the rural population, effectively recreating a system kind of like serfdom. This profound injustice sparked a powerful, deeply rooted movement in southern Mexico, famously led by the iconic revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. His unwavering rallying cry was the demand for the immediate return of these ejidos, the ancestral communal lands. Okay, so land was a massive issue. What else was fueling the fire? Second, there were severe and systemic labor issues. I mean, Mexican workers faced egregious exploitation at the hands of foreign industrialists who really prioritized profit over human dignity. And this wasn't unique to Mexico. It mirrored the brutal struggles of industrialization you saw in the US and England during the same period. Long hours, 12, 14 hours a day, meager wages, incredibly dangerous conditions. A powerful and infamous example was the cannonia strike in 1906. There, an American industrialist, Colonel William Greene, profited immensely from copper extraction in Sonora, but at the severe expense of Mexican workers. They earned significantly less than their American counterparts for the same work. And when they dared to demand better conditions, equal pay, they faced violent suppression. American rangers even crossed the border to help the Mexican authorities put it down. Wow. American rangers crossing the border. That really highlights the foreign influence. Absolutely. And that ties into the third point. The pervasive presence of what was termed great power imperialism. Major global powers like the French, the Germans, and especially the Americans were, were actively and openly exploiting Mexico's rich natural resources, oil, minerals, timber, for their own profit. Little regard for Mexican sovereignty or the welfare of its people. This blatant economic extraction, often backed by diplomatic pressure or even military threats, further inflamed nationalist sentiment. Mexicans wanted true economic and political autonomy, not just from Spain's legacy, but from all foreign interference. Okay, so the stage is set. Massive discontent over land, labor and foreign exploitation. Then comes 1910. Here's where it gets really interesting, right? A seemingly minor detail sparks the whole thing off. Diaz makes this statement to an American journalist, James Creelman. He says, mexico is ready for democracy. The upcoming election will be open and fair. Exactly. And it was probably intended mostly for foreign consumption. You know, good pr. Diaz was celebrating Mexico's centennial of independence feeling confident. But a Berkeley educated Mexican intellectual and reformer, Francisco Madero, actually took him at his word. He thought Diaz meant it. It seems so. Madero genuinely believed there might be an opening for legitimate democratic change. So he began campaigning vigorously for the presidency. And what quickly became apparent was that Madero built a significant widespread following. Huge crowds. Turned out there was this palpable hunger among the Mexican people for genuine democracy, for an end to Diaz's rule. Diaz was shocked. He realized Madero might actually win a fair election. So he quickly reversed course. He. He had Madero jailed on false charges, removing him from the race, and then predictably, ran unopposed and got reelected. But that didn't work out as planned for Diaz. No, it backfired dramatically. Madero, even from jail, became a bigger symbol. He managed a daring escape, fled to Texas, and then announced the Plan de San Luis Potosi. And a plan in Mexican history isn't just a suggestion. It's a revolutionary blueprint, a declaration of rebellion, a plan for a new government. And that was the spark. That was the spark. Rebellions erupted with astonishing speed and intensity all over Mexico. And these weren't just isolated uprisings. It was a powerful confluence. Madero supporters wanting political reform, workers demanding labor rights, nationalists wanting economic autonomy, and crucially, a Zapata's fierce followers in the south demanding fundamental land reform. This widespread, unified revolt proved too much for Diaz's aging regime. He was forced to resign, fled to France, end of the Porfiriato. Madero then became provisional president and was subsequently legitimately elected under the existing 1857 Constitution. His slogan, Effective suffrage, no reelection, so democracy arrives. Problem solved. Not quite. Despite his ideals, Madero failed to fully address the deep seated land reform issue that was a core demand, especially for Zapata. This unfulfilled promise led to continued rebellion by Zapata against Maderos. And tragically, it ended with Madero having Zapata murdered in a betrayal that further destabilized the government and just deepened the cycle of violence. So the chaos continued and foreign powers watching their investments, they got involved again. Oh yes. Mexico remained tumultuous. Foreign powers, especially those with huge investments, wanted order. And order that benefited them. Seeing Madera's government struggling, these foreign ambassadors, particularly the American ambassador at the time, Henry Lane Wilson, no relation to President Wilson, took matters into their own hands. They struck a deal with General Victoriano Huerta, the commander of the Mexican army, to stage a coup and restore stability, essentially bringing back a Diaz like regime. And the American ambassador endorsed this coup, openly endorsed it, believing it would protect American business interests and end the revolutionary turmoil quickly. This led to a brutal, concentrated ten day civil war right in Mexico City in February 1913, horrifyingly known as La Decina Tragica. The tragic ten days. It ended with Huerta consolidating power. President Madero and his vice president were arrested and then, under very suspicious circumstances, shot while supposedly trying to escape. Huerta was in control. But the new US President, Woodrow Wilson, had a different view. A very different view. Woodrow Wilson saw Fuerte's regime as illegitimate, morally repugnant wisdom. Wilson was a staunch idealist. He strongly believed that since Madero had been legitimately elected, any government that overthrew him by force was inherently undemocratic and unacceptable to the United States. He refused to recognize Huerta's government. So Wilson looked for a way to intervene. He did. He sought an excuse framed in terms of supporting democracy and justice, but also protecting American interests. He found it in the 1914 Tempico incident. A small group of US Navy sailors landed in Tampico to buy fuel and. And they were arrested by Huerta's officers. They were quickly released. An apology was issued, but Wilson seized on it. Under international law, boarding a U.S. navy boat was technically like invading American soil. Wilson used this as justification not for a full war, but for a targeted intervention. The occupation of Veracruz. Veracruz, the main port in Customs House. Exactly. Strategic move. Cut off Huerta's funds from customs duties, cut off his access to arms. It crippled him. And this action did eventually lead to Huerta's fall. He was replaced by Venustiano Carranza, leader of the constitutionalists. But Carranza, a staunch nationalist who deeply resented foreign intervention, immediately demanded the US withdraw from Veracruz. The US did in late 1914. But this intervention created significant, lasting tension and deep mistrust. Sowed seeds a future problem. And the relationship didn't get better soon, did it? There was Ponto Villa, right after Carranza took power. Another powerful revolutionary figure, Pancho Villa, who had fought with Carranza but now turned against him, became this sort of Robin Hood figure. In northern Mexico, Villa was fighting Carranza's government. And in the convoluted politics, the US government initially offered him support, seeing him as maybe an alternative to Carranza. But then they switched sides. They did. When Villa's prospects dimmed, the US government abroad abruptly cut off his arms supply and switched its support to Carranza. They effectively abandoned Villa, which Villa didn't take kindly to. Not at all. This perceived betrayal prompted Villa to retaliate. In a bold, incredibly provocative move. In March 1916, he invaded Columbus, New Mexico, attacked a U.S. army outpost. The town itself killed several American soldiers and civilians. And that led to the punitive expedition? Correct. Wilson, facing intense public outcry and concerned about border security, dispatched General John Blackjack Pershing later lead American forces in Europe deep into Mexico. The explicit aim, capture Villa dead or alive. But the expedition quickly ran into trouble. Finding Villa in that vast rugged terrain was incredibly difficult. And then a direct clash occurred between U.S. forces and Mexican forces loyal to Toranza, raising the terrifying specter of a full scale US Mexico war. But Wilson pulled back. Why? Because President Wilson was increasingly aware of the growing existential conflict in Europe. The he foresaw America's inevitable involvement in the Great War. He shrewdly recognized the US simply could not afford to get bogged down in a prolonged, costly war with Mexico. When the global stakes in Europe were rising so dramatically, military readiness for Europe was paramount. So he ordered the withdrawal. Yes, in January 1917. While necessary, it left us Mexican relations incredibly strained, deeply mistrustful. Right on the eve of America's entry into World War I. Even though Mexico adopted its progressive 1917 constitution around then, addressing land reform, reform, subsoil rights, the damage to the relationship was done. This whole complex sequence, shifting allegiances, interventions, border clashes, withdrawal, it's a fascinating foreshadowing of American foreign policy. That mix of idealism, economic interests, pragmatic global assessment and military force, often with mixed results. Okay, so with that crucial context from Mexico, the interventionism, the strained relations, let's pivot decisively back to Europe. The Great War is reaching its absolute brutal climax. 1917 is a huge turning point, a massive turning point. And one of the most significant shifts on the European front happened with the Russian revolution in February, March 1917. What we often call the Russian Revolution actually began then with the overthrow of the Tsar and the establishment of a provisional government. This was initially dominated by the Mensheviks, not the Bolsheviks yet. Not yet. The Mensheviks were a minority faction within Russian socialism. Unlike Lenin's Bolsheviks, they followed a more orthodox Marxist theory. They believed Russia needed to go through a liberal capitalist stage first, build industry, establish democracy before it could transition to communism. So they aimed for a liberal democratic republic. But politically, what did their revolution mean for the war effort? Critically, it meant Russia as a major effective fighting force was essentially taken out of World War I. Their internal struggles, the chaos, and it crippled their military capacity. Mass desertions, collapsing front lines. This dramatic withdrawal of a major allied power presented Germany with an incredible, though desperate opportunity. It prompted them to make a crucial all in calculation. They planned a massive decisive offensive for 1918. Their belief was with Russia effectively out, they could concentrate all their forces from the Eastern front onto the Western Front, overwhelm France and Britain, secure a definitive victory before the United States could fight fully, deploy its troops and make a decisive difference. It was a high stakes gamble when before America arrived in force. But Germany's strategic gambles in early 1917, they really backfired in terms of bringing the US into the war, didn't they? Two specific actions just lit the fuse. They absolutely did. While perhaps logical from their desperate perspective, these actions irrevocably pushed the US from neutrality into the conflict. First, and this was a direct affront, Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare on February 1, 1917. Right. A direct, blatant violation of President Wilson's earlier warning of strict accountability after the lusitania sinking in 1915. Over a thousand lives lost then, including 128Americans. Germany had briefly halted it under US pressure, but now they were doubling down. Any ship, military, civilian, neutral, belligerent, entering designated war zones would be sunk without warning. Why take that risk? They must have known how the US would react. They did. But they felt they had to. They were suffering badly under the British blockade. They believed their U boats could sink enough allied shipping, especially to Britain, to force a surrender within maybe six months. Their intelligence suggested the US couldn't deploy troops fast enough across the Atlantic to matter before Britain and France collapsed. And for a time, the U boats were devastatingly effective, sinking maybe 25 merchant vessels a day. Early that year it was taking a huge toll on Britain, threatening to starve them into submission. Their calculation was purely military and economic. Win fast before the Americans could fully mobilize. Okay, so that's one major provocation. The second one was perhaps even more inflammatory, certainly more shocking to the American public. The Zimmerman telegram. Ah, yes, the Zimmerman Telegram. In January 1917, German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmerman sent a secret coded telegram to the German ambassador in Mexico. The instructions were to propose an alliance with the President of Mexico, Venusiano Carranza, the same nationalist leader who'd just dealt with Pershing's expedition. An alliance with Mexico against the U.S. exactly. An extraordinary, audacious proposal. The message was, if the United States declared war on Germany, Mexico should join Germany's side. And in return, upon a German victory, Mexico would regain lost territories. Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Lands lost decades earlier in the Mexican American War. How did this even come out? British intelligence intercepted and cleverly decoded it. Then they strategically leaked it to the American Press in February 1917. And then, rather astonishingly, Zimmerman himself confirmed its authenticity in March. When that happened, Americans were absolutely furious. I can imagine. Not just the threat, but the audacity. Precisely. The outrage wasn't just about the direct threat to American territory. It tapped into this prevalent, often patronizing American attitude towards Mexico. Mexico. At the time, many Americans saw Mexico as backward or little brown brothers needing guidance, not a legitimate nation. That could pose a serious challenge, especially not with German backing. The idea of Mexico reclaiming lost lands with German help was seen as both a grave insult and a direct national security threat. British propaganda brilliantly leveraged this. It painted Germany as a rogue, untrustworthy state and decisively swayed American public opinion towards the Allies and towards entering the war. The irony, of course, is palpable. So, unrestricted submarine warfare, killing Americans, and a direct plot with Mexico to invade U.S. territory. That pretty much sealed the deal. It did. On April 6, 1917, spurred by these undeniable German provocations, the United States officially declared war. But it wasn't unanimous, was it? There was still opposition. No, not unanimous by any stretch. Significant dissent remained. Some argued passionately. It was a war for merchant interests, for business profits. An argument Wilson vehemently countered. You also has lingering anti British sentiment, especially from Irish Americans with deep historical grievances, and others still wary of Britain from the American Revolution days. So how did Wilson rally support? How did the narrative shift? The narrative shifted dramatically, largely due to Wilson's powerful idealistic rhetoric. And the timing of the Russian Revolution helped. With Russia, previously an autocratic empire, now becoming a republic, Wilson reframed the conflict. It wasn't about economic gain or old rivalries. It was a grand moral struggle. He portrayed it as a global fight between democracy, the us, Britain, France, and now republican Russia, and authoritarianism embodied by Germany, Austria, Hungary, the Ottoman Empire. Make the world safer democracy. That was the line. This appeal to deeply ingrained American ideals, the mission to spread and defend democracy Globally became the enduring justification for U.S. foreign policy interventions ever since. We've seen it invoked repeatedly. Right. Iraq, Libya, Vietnam. Which raises that question you touched on earlier. Is it pure idealism or a convenient justification for other interests? Exactly. It's a question historians still debate. Is it genuine belief in spreading freedom or a moral cloak for economic, strategic or resource chains? Think about Iraq in the 2000s. Democracy was the stated reason, but Iraq has vast oil reserves. Rwanda, during its genocide, didn't. Did that play a role? Or Vietnam, initially supporting French imperialism, later framed as protecting democracy from communism. It's this complex interplay of high minded ideals and pragmatic, often material interests. It's a recurring theme rooted right here in wwi. That's a profound point. Absolutely. How we untangle those motivations is key. But despite the initial skepticism, once war was declared, the US mobilized incredibly quickly. Remarkably quickly. The first significant contingent of the American expeditionary forces, the AEF, landed in June 1917. Major combat involvement started by October and the deployment ramped up fast. By March 1918, just a year after declaring war, over a million American troops were already in France. How was that possible so fast? It was partly a testament to Wilson's foresight. He'd begun military training and preparedness measures even before the formal declaration. Anticipating the need, the nation shifted from neutrality to global player with extraordinary speed. And once they got there, how did the American troops perform? They proved themselves formidable warriors. Their courage, their fighting ability, their sheer numbers. They quarterly earned a fearsome reputation among the Germans. The Germans supposedly nicknamed them Puffel Hunden, Devil Dogs. The Marine Corps famously attributes this to their heroic actions at the Battle of Belleau Wood in June 1918. Belleau Wood. A really brutal battle. Incredibly brutal. The Marines launched repeated, costly assaults against entrenched German positions. Whether the nickname originated there specifically or was used more generally, it cemented the image. The American fighting man is relentless, terrifying. They injected fresh vigor, confidence and much needed morale into the exhausted Allied lines. After nearly four years of war, their arrival signaled a decisive new phase. Okay, so American troops are pouring in, proving their mettle. Germany knows its window is closing fast. They have to act decisively. Exactly. Their strategic calculation was achieve victory now or face inevitable defeat under the growing weight of American manpower and industry. So by March 1918, in a desperate last gasp effort, they launched their final major offensive on the Western Front. The Spring Offensive, or Ludendorff Offensive. The aim was audacious. Break Allied lines, secure that definitive victory before the full overwhelming force of US troops could be brought against. Then did it work? Initially, it seemed quite successful. Initially, yes. They gained alarming amounts of territory, pushed deep into Allied lines, caused significant casualties. They advanced rapidly, sometimes dozens of miles, but they outran their supply lines. They exhausted their most elite stormtroopers in the initial assaults and critically, they failed to capture key strategic objectives, like the vital rail hub of Amien. The land gained was often difficult to defend, while required massive logistical effort and didn't achieve the strategic goal of breaking the Allied will or capturing Paris. By July 1918, the tide had unequivocally turned because the Americans were really making their presence felt by then. Absolutely. The Allies, now significantly bolstered by rapidly increasing numbers of fresh, highly motivated American troops, regained the numerical advantage. And they learned from the initial German successes. This set the stage for their decisive counteroffensive, known as the 100 days offensive, which began in August. The Hundred Days Offensive. This was the final push. It was a strategic masterpiece, really. Showing renewed Allied coordination and American combat power, it successfully broke through the Hindenburg Line, Germany's supposedly impenetrable defense system. Exactly. High tech trenches, bunkers, barbed wire. It had held for years, but it crumbled under the sustained Allied assault, often spearheaded by fresh American troops, fighting with incredible ferocity. With their lines broken, their army in disarray, morale plummeting, facing overwhelming numbers, Germany's high command, Ludendorff included, saw no path to victory. They advised the civilian government that military defeat was inevitable. They recommended seeking peace based on President Wilson's 14 points. Ah, the 14 points. Wilson's visionary, profoundly idealistic blueprint for a post war world. His grand design for lasting peace. Yes, his core tenets. No more secret treaties. Global disarmament, free trade for all, freedom of the seas. And perhaps most revolutionary for the time, national self determination. The radical idea that people should govern themselves, choose their own destiny without external interference. And of course, the League of Nations. Right. The cornerstone. A League of nations to ensure collective security, resolve disputes peacefully through diplomacy, not war. A completely new international order meant to replace the old imperialistic ways. And Wilson was uncompromising about negotiating with the Kaiser. Utterly uncompromising. When Germany first sought an armistice, Wilson refused to deal directly with Kaiser Wilhelm ii. Wilson demanded Germany first transition to a more democratic government. He believed monarchies were inherently prone to war. This immense pressure directly led to the Kaiser's abdication on November 9, 1918. Then the establishment of the Weimar Republic, a new fledgling democracy. Only then did this new German government formally request an armistice. And the armistice itself. The timing was strange, wasn't it? Signed at 6am, effective at 11am it was signed in that railway car in Compigne Forest at 6am, November 11, 1918, but stipulated to take effect five hours later at 11am, supposedly to allow orders to reach the front lines. But fighting continued during those five hours? Tragically, yes. Which raises that deeply troubling question why both sides knew peace was literally hours away. The numbers are just Stark Senseless. Almost 11,000 casualties, nearly 3,000 deaths in that final, amazingly stupid five hour period. Lives lost, attacking positions that would be freely occupied moments later, or just due to final artillery barrages already ordered. It highlights the horrific momentum, the sheer inertia of total war. Just chilling. Four was over. But the path to peace, well that was just beginning. And it was anything but simple. Versailles, January 1919. Right. The Versailles conference in Paris, yeah, meant to shape the new world order. Allied delegations gathered, Germany was there, but under duress, effectively sidelined. They weren't allowed to participate in the negotiations that would determine their fate and the fate of much of the world. It was very much a peace imposed, not negotiated. A fact with profound consequences. Wilson arrived with his idealistic vision. Right, Peace without victory. He did, he argued passionately for Germany to be treated with some fairness, to establish justice, foster democracy, not impose punitive measures that might breed future conflict. His 14 points push for collective security via the League, unrestricted free trade and that controversial idea of national self determination. Every people choosing its own governance, ideally democratic, but that clashed dramatically with what Britain and France wanted. Dramatically and fundamentally. Britain and especially France had endured horrific losses. And they held vast global empires. The very notion of national self determination was deeply threatening to them. They weren't keen on their colonized people suddenly choosing their own destiny and dismantling their empires. France under Clemenceau had suffered devastating losses on its own soil. His focus was security from Germany and harsh reparations. Full stop. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, maybe more moderate, but still sought to protect the British Empire, maintained naval supremacy, ensure Germany paid. They wanted punitive retribution, territorial gains, security. Not a new world order based on abstract American ideals. This clash, Wilson's idealism versus European realpolitik, defined the harsh outcome. And this clash had real world consequences, didn't it? Affecting people far beyond Europe, like Ho Chi Minh, a powerful example. Ho Chi Minh, who would later lead Vietnam's fight for independence, was a young Vietnamese man working as a busboy in Paris. During the conference, he was utterly inspired by Wilson's rhetoric of self determination. He thought, surely this applies to us, to Vietnam under French rule. He wrote a heartfelt letter, even rented a proper suit. Tried to meet Wilson to promote Vietnamese nationalism and independence. But Wilson didn't meet him. No. France had zero intention of relinquishing Indo, Ghana. Wilson focused on Europe under pressure from the Allies. Never met him. The letter likely went unread. The tragic unintended consequence. Ho Chi Minh, deeply disillusioned by the hypocrisy, seeing Western powers not living up to their own ideals, went to Moscow. He joined the Communist International, dedicated himself to the communist cause, eventually leading the Viet Minh, becoming an enemy of the US Decades later in the Vietnam War. It's a clear example of how Western hard headedness, their self interest, inadvertently pushed nationalist movements towards communism, set the stage for future conflict. Another example of self determination being ignored. W.E.B. dubois was there too, right? Advocating for Pan Africanism. He was the eminent American intellectual and civil rights leader, tirelessly championed Pan Africanism. It envisioned a united Africa free from colonial rule. More broadly, it was a movement for people of African descent worldwide to unite, foster shared identity, solidarity. It influenced movements like the Nation of Islam, later like the song Africa Unite. Exactly. That's the deeper meaning. Unity, liberation, self determination for people of African descent. But sadly, despite these powerful voices, neither Pan Africanism nor broad self determination for colonized peoples was realized at Versailles. The colonial powers just carved up more of the world, often rebranding colonies as mandates under the League. Business as usual, really, just with new labels. So of Wilson's 14 points, only the League of Nations really made it through. And even that struggled pretty much. And even the League faced an uphill battle. Wilson faced opposition from European powers wary of collective security, infringing on their sovereignty. And crucially, he faced fierce isolationist opposition back home in the us his health declined markedly during the intense Paris debates. Upon his return, Congress, led by Republicans like Henry Cabot Lodge, refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles or join the League. They feared entanglement in foreign conflicts, loss of sovereignty. Wilson tried to fight for it, he did. Embarked on a national tour to rally public support, but tragically suffered a debilitating stroke during the Tour. It effectively ended his political career and any chance of American leadership in the League he'd championed. His idealism, it seems, just wasn't suited to or strong enough against the harsh Realities of 20th century World politics and entrenched national interests. So after all that, what did versailles actually produce? 5 major treaties. Redrawing the map. That's right. The Treaty of Versailles with Germany was the big one. An incredibly punitive, drastic disarmament army limited to 100,000. No air force, no submarines. The infamous war guilt clause, Article 231, forcing Germany to accept full responsibility and massive financial reparations. Later set at 132 billion gold marks. Astronomical crippling. A recipe for resentment? Absolutely. Humiliation, military impotence, economic burden. It fueled deep festering resentment, directly paving the way for future conflict. Then the other treaties dismantled the old empires. St. Germain broke up Austria, Hungary created Czechoslovakia. Yugoslavia reduced Austria, Hungary drastically. Newly stripped Bulgaria of territory, gave much to Yugoslavia, denied it agent access. Triana inflicted immense losses on Hungary, lost two thirds of its territory, 58% of its population now outside its borders. Lasting grievance there. And the Treaty of Sevres, later revised by Lausanne, dissolved the vast Ottoman Empire. Laying the groundwork for many modern Middle Eastern states. And these map makers, they just drew lines, often ignoring who actually lived there? Pretty much. They sat down with pencils, drew new borders, often with shocking disregard for demographic, ethnic, religious, historical realities. They carved up empires, created new nations, based primarily on the strategic and political calculations of the victors, not always on self determination. And the consequences are still with us profoundly. In Europe you got multinational entities like Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, conceived as unified nations, but eventually fragmented violently due to those underlying ethnic tensions. The border suppressed, but didn't resolve. And maybe even more consequentially in the Middle East. Dissolving the Ottoman Empire led to these mandates, territories governed by Britain and France, supposedly preparing them for democracy. Jordan, Palestine and significantly, Iraq. Iraq, never a country before 1920, never an artificial creation cobbled together by Britain from three distinct, often hostile Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Kurds, different histories, identities, sometimes outright animosity, glued together into one nation to serve British strategic interests, primarily access to vast newly discovered oil resources. The democracy talk was often cover for resource control, which raises that provocative thought right? If studying history is so crucial, why did American leaders, nearly a century later, spend years and lives trying to maintain the nation of Iraq, this historical creation with imposed borders, as if it had some deep pre existing national identity. It illustrates the profound, often tragic consequences of neglecting historical context, ignoring the artificiality of borders drawn by distant powers with imperial motives. So looking back at Versailles, legacy, it's often called a peace that failed. Is that fair? I think cataclysmic is perhaps a better word for its legacy. It undeniably sowed the seeds for much of the 20th century's subsequent turmoil, directly leading to World War II. First, the sheer scale of economic devastation, the immense war debts, Germany's crippling reparations. It created a precarious Global economy, setting the stage for the Great Depression, which destabilized democracies and fueled extremism worldwide. Second, most directly, the extreme harshness of Versailles. War guilt reparations fueled that deep German resentment. They felt humiliated, unjustly punished, suffocated by the diktat. This created fertile ground for extremists like Hitler and the Nazis promising to restrain pride, overturn the treaty, seek revenge, led directly to World War II just 20 years later. And the League of Nations didn't help. Third, ineffective collective security. The League, Wilson's brainchild, proved toothless. Without U.S. participation, it lacked moral authority, military enforcement capability. This weakness encouraged international adventurism. Italy invading Ethiopia in 35, Japan expanding into Manchuria and China. The League condemned but couldn't act. It showed aggressors they could act largely unchecked. And finally, the fundamental rejection of Wilson's idealism and the persistence of of old imperial aims by Britain and France that laid groundwork for ongoing global conflicts. Those arbitrary borders drawn at Versailles. Europe, Africa, Middle east, ignored realities, contained simmering tensions that would erupt repeatedly. Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Middle East. Wilson was in many ways prophetic. He understood the world couldn't continue with 19th century imperial practices. But the European powers, clinging to empires, seeking retribution, couldn't appreciate his vision leading directly to the tragedies that follow followed. A peace imposed without justice rarely lasts. So wrapping this up, what really stands out to you from this deep dive into the Great War Part 2? We've covered so much ground, from Mexico's internal struggles echoing globally, to American idealism clashing with European realpolitik and this peace treaty that, well, basically set the stage for the next war and beyond. What stands out is that profound interconnectedness, how decisions in one placemexico city, Washington, Berlin, Paris, trigger cascades of events reshaping continents, defining centuries. It really underscores that being truly well informed means understanding these deep, often hidden historical currents, seeing the echoes of Zimmerman, of Versailles in today's headlines. Yeah, the period from 1917 to 1921 wasn't just about ending a war. It was the messy, painful birth of a new world order full of compromises, unintended consequences, and these deeply lingering resentments that still shape things now. Which leads to a final thought, maybe for you. How many of the global conflicts, the intractable problems we grapple with today, from regional instabilities to longstanding national grievances, how many might still be echoing those unresolved tensions, those arbitrary lines drawn a century ago at places like Versailles by men who couldn't possibly foresee the profound long term consequences. Food for thought for sure. We hope this deep dive has given you a richer, more nuanced understanding of this pivotal era and its really lasting impact on our world. Until next time, keep digging into those fascinating stories that shape our world.

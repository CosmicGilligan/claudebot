</div>

## üéØ The Massive Question That Haunts Us Still

**How does a nation go from reluctant isolationist to global superpower in just four years - and why does its first attempt at world leadership create more problems than it solves?**

Welcome to the explosive conclusion of our Great War trilogy! We've seen how Europe's peace system collapsed into catastrophe, and how Imperial Russia crumbled into communist revolution. Now we witness America's dramatic entrance onto the world stage - but this isn't just about the final battles of WWI. We're exploring something much more profound: **how the United States learned to project power globally by practicing first on its neighbor Mexico, and how its idealistic president's vision of world peace crashed against European realpolitik to create the conditions for an even more devastating war.**

This is the story of how the modern world was born - messy, violent, and full of unintended consequences that echo through today's headlines.

## üá≤üáΩ The Mexican Laboratory: Where America Learned to Intervene

### The Porfiriato: "Modernize or Be Colonized"

Before we can understand how America emerged as a global power, we need to understand what was happening right next door in Mexico üèóÔ∏è. The story begins with **Porfirio D√≠az**, who ruled Mexico with an iron fist from 1876 to 1910 in what was called the **Porfiriato**.

D√≠az's motto? **"Liberty, Order, Progress"** - but in that exact sequence. His advisors, the *cient√≠ficos*, believed in applying "scientific" methods to governance. First you impose order through strong rule, then you achieve progress through modernization, and *eventually* you might get some liberty.

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e3c72 0%, #2a5298 50%, #1e3c72 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 5px solid #ffd700;">
<h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">üìä The Porfiriato's Brutal Logic</h4>
<ul style="color: #e8e8e8;">
<li><strong>The Promise:</strong> Economic modernization and foreign investment</li>
<li><strong>The Method:</strong> "Pan o palo" (Bread or the stick) - rewards for compliance, violence for dissent</li>
<li><strong>The Result:</strong> Mexico's wealth extracted by foreign companies while Mexicans remained poor</li>
<li><strong>The Enforcer:</strong> The *rurales* - rural police often recruited from bandit gangs</li>
</ul>
</div>

**Here's the tragic irony:** D√≠az succeeded in modernizing Mexico's economy, but all the wealth flowed to foreign investors - Americans, Germans, French. Mexicans saw their country's resources extracted while they remained impoverished and disenfranchised. Sound familiar? This pattern of economic modernization benefiting outsiders while locals suffer would repeat across the developing world.

### The Spark: Democracy's Dangerous Promise

In 1910, celebrating Mexico's centennial of independence, D√≠az made a **fatal mistake** üòÖ. He told an American journalist that "Mexico is ready for democracy" and promised open elections. He probably meant it as PR for foreign consumption.

But **Francisco Madero**, a Berkeley-educated idealist, took him seriously! Madero campaigned vigorously and built massive crowds. D√≠az realized Madero might actually *win* a fair election, so he had him arrested and ran unopposed.

**Big mistake.** Madero escaped to Texas and issued the **Plan de San Luis Potos√≠** - not just a suggestion, but a revolutionary blueprint declaring D√≠az's government illegitimate. The revolution exploded across Mexico with astonishing speed.

### The Revolution Devours Its Children

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #8b0000 0%, #dc143c 50%, #8b0000 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 5px solid #ffd700;">
<h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">üîÑ Revolution and Counter-Revolution Cycle</h4>
<ul style="color: #e8e8e8;">
<li><strong>1911:</strong> D√≠az flees, Madero becomes president</li>
<li><strong>Problem:</strong> Madero fails to deliver land reform, especially to Emiliano Zapata's followers</li>
<li><strong>1913:</strong> General Victoriano Huerta stages coup with foreign backing</li>
<li><strong>La Decena Tr√°gica:</strong> Ten days of brutal civil war in Mexico City</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Madero and VP shot "while trying to escape"</li>
</ul>
</div>

But here's where it gets really interesting for American foreign policy: **Woodrow Wilson refused to recognize Huerta's government** üö´. Wilson was an idealist who believed that since Madero had been legitimately elected, any government that overthrew him by force was inherently undemocratic and unacceptable.

This was **revolutionary thinking** in international relations! Traditionally, great powers recognized whoever controlled territory, regardless of how they got there. Wilson was introducing a new principle: **legitimacy mattered, not just effective control.**

### America's First Intervention: The Veracruz Experiment

Wilson looked for an excuse to intervene against Huerta, and found it in the **Tampico Incident** ‚öì. Some U.S. Navy sailors were briefly arrested while buying fuel (they were quickly released with apologies). Wilson used this minor incident to justify occupying **Veracruz** - Mexico's main port and customs house.

**Brilliant strategy:** Without firing a shot at the Mexican government directly, Wilson cut off Huerta's revenue from customs duties and access to arms shipments. Huerta's government collapsed.

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #6a5acd 0%, #9370db 50%, #8a2be2 100%); padding: 25px; border-radius: 15px; margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 0 8px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);">
<h3 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">üé≠ The Intervention Playbook: Mexico as Practice</h3>
<p style="color: #e8e8e8; font-size: 1.1em;">Notice the pattern Wilson established:</p>
<ol style="color: #e8e8e8; line-height: 1.6;">
<li><strong>Moral Justification:</strong> Frame intervention as supporting democracy</li>
<li><strong>Economic Pressure:</strong> Cut off revenue and supplies</li>
<li><strong>Limited Military Action:</strong> Targeted strikes, not full invasion</li>
<li><strong>Regime Change:</strong> Force out "illegitimate" leaders</li>
<li><strong>Quick Withdrawal:</strong> Leave when immediate goals achieved</li>
</ol>
<p style="color: #ffd700; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 0;">This became the template for American interventions worldwide!</p>
</div>

### Pancho Villa and the Punitive Expedition

But Mexico wasn't done teaching America lessons about intervention üêé. When the U.S. switched support from **Pancho Villa** to **Venustiano Carranza**, Villa felt betrayed. His response? **Raid Columbus, New Mexico** in March 1916, killing American soldiers and civilians.

Wilson sent **General John "Black Jack" Pershing** deep into Mexico to capture Villa "dead or alive." But Villa proved uncatchable in Mexico's vast terrain, and when U.S. forces clashed with Carranza's troops, Wilson faced the prospect of full-scale war with Mexico.

**Here's the crucial lesson:** Wilson pulled back in January 1917, not because of failure, but because **bigger global stakes demanded attention**. He couldn't afford to be bogged down in Mexico when war with Germany loomed.

**This taught America a fundamental strategic principle:** Don't get distracted by regional conflicts when global hegemony is at stake.

## üá∫üá∏ America Enters the World Stage: From Neutral to Decisive

### The Perfect Storm of 1917

By early 1917, everything was coming together to pull America into the European war üå™Ô∏è:

**üî¥ Russian Collapse:** The February Revolution removed Russia as an effective fighting force, giving Germany hope for victory before American troops could arrive.

**üö¢ Unrestricted Submarine Warfare:** Germany resumed sinking ships without warning on February 1, 1917, directly violating Wilson's "strict accountability" warning.

**üì± The Zimmermann Telegram:** Germany's proposal to Mexico (alliance against the U.S. in exchange for recovering Texas, Arizona, New Mexico) was intercepted by British intelligence and revealed in March 1917.

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #2c1810 0%, #8b4513 50%, #654321 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 5px solid #ff6347;">
<h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">‚ö° The Zimmermann Telegram's Shocking Audacity</h4>
<ul style="color: #e8e8e8;">
<li><strong>The Proposal:</strong> Mexico should ally with Germany if U.S. enters war</li>
<li><strong>The Reward:</strong> Germany would help Mexico reclaim "lost territories"</li>
<li><strong>The Insult:</strong> Americans saw Mexico as incapable of serious threat</li>
<li><strong>The Impact:</strong> Transformed public opinion from division to unity</li>
</ul>
</div>

But there was still opposition to war. Irish Americans hated Britain. German Americans opposed fighting their homeland. Isolationists argued it was a war for business profits.

### Wilson's Masterstroke: Making the World Safe for Democracy

Wilson's genius was **reframing the entire conflict** üéØ. With Russia now a republic (briefly), he could present the war as a clear moral struggle:

**Democracy vs. Autocracy**
- **Democratic Side:** United States, Britain, France, Republican Russia
- **Autocratic Side:** Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire

The slogan **"Make the World Safe for Democracy"** became the justification not just for this war, but for American global interventions ever since. Iraq 2003? Libya 2011? Vietnam? The same moral framework Wilson established in 1917.

**The uncomfortable question:** Is this genuine idealism or a convenient cover for strategic and economic interests? Think about it - Iraq has vast oil reserves, Libya sits on Africa's largest oil reserves, Vietnam was about stopping communism. Rwanda, during its genocide, had neither oil nor strategic value. Did that influence American response?

### The "Devil Dogs" Arrive

American troops began arriving in June 1917, with major combat starting in October üêï. By March 1918, over a million American soldiers were in France. They earned their fearsome reputation quickly, allegedly being nicknamed **"Teufelhunden" (Devil Dogs)** by German troops after the brutal Battle of Belleau Wood.

**The impact was decisive:** Fresh, highly motivated American troops injected new energy into exhausted Allied forces. When Germany launched its final desperate offensive in spring 1918, American numbers and fighting power helped turn the tide.

---

## üí• 1918: The End Comes Fast

### Germany's Last Gamble

With Russia out of the war, Germany transferred massive forces to the Western Front for one final push üé≤. The **Spring Offensive** initially succeeded, gaining more territory than anyone had in years. But it exhausted Germany's elite stormtroopers and outran supply lines without achieving strategic objectives.

By July 1918, the Allies had regained numerical advantage. The **Hundred Days Offensive** beginning in August, often spearheaded by American troops, broke through the supposedly impregnable Hindenburg Line.

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #191970 0%, #4169e1 50%, #1e90ff 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 5px solid #ffd700;">
<h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">üìà The Mathematics of Defeat</h4>
<ul style="color: #e8e8e8;">
<li><strong>March 1918:</strong> Germany's offensive gains ground but exhausts reserves</li>
<li><strong>July 1918:</strong> Allies regain numerical advantage with American reinforcements</li>
<li><strong>August-November:</strong> Hundred Days Offensive breaks German lines</li>
<li><strong>November 11:</strong> Armistice signed, effective 11th hour of 11th day of 11th month</li>
</ul>
</div>

### The Bizarre Timing of Peace

Here's something that will haunt you: the Armistice was signed at 6 AM on November 11, 1918, but didn't take effect until **11 AM** ‚è∞. Fighting continued for five hours *after* peace was signed.

**The result?** Nearly 11,000 casualties, almost 3,000 deaths, in those final five hours. Men died attacking positions they would occupy peacefully moments later. It shows the horrific momentum of total war - once started, the machinery of death becomes almost impossible to stop immediately.

## üïäÔ∏è Wilson's Vision: "War to End All Wars"

### The Fourteen Points: Blueprint for a New World

Wilson arrived at the Paris Peace Conference with his **Fourteen Points** - a revolutionary vision for international relations üìú:

1. **No secret treaties** (diplomacy in the open)
2. **Freedom of the seas** (unrestricted navigation)
3. **Free trade** (economic interdependence prevents war)
4. **Disarmament** (arms races cause wars)
5. **National self-determination** (people choose their government)
6. **League of Nations** (collective security through international organization)

This was **missionary diplomacy** - the idea that American values should guide world politics. Wilson genuinely believed he could reshape international relations based on democratic principles and moral idealism.

### The Clash of Visions at Versailles

But Wilson's idealism crashed hard against European realpolitik üí•:

**üá´üá∑ France (Clemenceau):** Wanted security from Germany through harsh punishment, massive reparations, and permanent weakening.

**üá¨üáß Britain (Lloyd George):** Wanted to protect the British Empire, maintain naval supremacy, and ensure Germany paid for war damages.

**üá∫üá∏ Wilson:** Wanted justice, democracy, and a new international order based on collective security.

<h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">üíî The Tragedy of Self-Determination Denied</h4>
<ul style="color: #2c1810;">
<li><strong>Ho Chi Minh:</strong> Vietnamese nationalist inspired by Wilson's words, ignored by Wilson himself</li>
<li><strong>W.E.B. DuBois:</strong> Promoted Pan-Africanism, African unity and self-rule - dismissed by colonial powers</li>
<li><strong>The Irony:</strong> Self-determination applied only to European peoples</li>
<li><strong>The Consequence:</strong> Disappointed nationalists turned to communism for support</li>
</ul>
</div>

### The Personal Tragedy of Idealism

Wilson fought tirelessly for his vision, but his health collapsed under the strain üò∑. He suffered a debilitating stroke while touring America to rally support for the League of Nations. 

**The ultimate irony:** The country that proposed the League of Nations never joined it. The U.S. Senate, led by Henry Cabot Lodge, rejected the Treaty of Versailles and American membership in the League, fearing entanglement in foreign conflicts.

Wilson's idealistic vision died with his political career.

## üó∫Ô∏è The Peace That Failed: Creating Tomorrow's Wars

### The Treaties: Redrawing the World with Pencils

The Paris Peace Conference produced **five major treaties** that literally redrew the map of the world:

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e3c72 0%, #2a5298 50%, #1e3c72 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 5px solid #ffd700;">
<h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">üåç The Five Treaties That Shaped Our World</h4>
<ul style="color: #e8e8e8;">
<li><strong>Versailles (Germany):</strong> War guilt, disarmament, massive reparations</li>
<li><strong>St. Germain (Austria):</strong> Created Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia; reduced Austria drastically</li>
<li><strong>Trianon (Hungary):</strong> Lost 2/3 of territory, 58% of population</li>
<li><strong>Neuilly (Bulgaria):</strong> Lost territory to Yugoslavia, denied sea access</li>
<li><strong>S√®vres/Lausanne (Ottoman Empire):</strong> Dissolved empire, created Middle Eastern mandates</li>
</ul>
</div>

### The Iraq Experiment: Creating Countries from Maps

Here's a perfect example of how Versailles created future problems: **Iraq** üáÆüá∂. 

Iraq never existed as a country before 1920. British officials literally drew lines on a map, combining three distinct Ottoman provinces with different peoples who often hated each other:
- **Sunni Arabs** in the center
- **Shia Arabs** in the south  
- **Kurds** in the north

**Why did Britain create this artificial state?** Oil. Pure and simple. Britain wanted to control Mesopotamia's vast newly-discovered oil resources under the guise of a "mandate" to prepare the region for democracy.

**The tragic question:** If studying history matters so much, why did American leaders nearly a century later spend years and lives trying to maintain this artificial creation as if it had some deep, pre-existing national identity?

### The Economic Time Bomb

The treaties also created **economic catastrophe** üí∞:

- **War debts** from Allied borrowing
- **German reparations** set at 132 billion gold marks
- **Destroyed industrial capacity** across Europe
- **Disrupted trade networks** and currencies

This economic devastation set the stage for the **Great Depression**, which destabilized democracies worldwide and fueled extremist movements.

---

## üîÆ The Unintended Consequences: Seeds of Future Wars

### The German Resentment

The **Treaty of Versailles** with Germany was deliberately punitive üò°:

- **Article 231 (War Guilt Clause):** Germany accepts full responsibility
- **Military restrictions:** Army limited to 100,000, no air force, no submarines
- **Territorial losses:** Alsace-Lorraine to France, Polish corridor, Saar Basin
- **Reparations:** Astronomical payments that crippled the economy

**The result?** Deep, festering resentment that extremists like Hitler could exploit. Germans felt humiliated, unjustly punished, and suffocated by an imposed *diktat*.

### The League's Fatal Weakness

Without U.S. participation, the **League of Nations** lacked both moral authority and enforcement capability üèõÔ∏è. When aggressors acted - Italy in Ethiopia (1935), Japan in Manchuria (1931) - the League condemned but couldn't act effectively.

This weakness encouraged international adventurism and showed potential aggressors they could act largely unchecked.

### The Colonial Contradiction

The most fundamental problem was the **rejection of Wilson's own principles** by his allies üåç. Britain and France had no intention of applying "self-determination" to their own empires. They simply rebranded colonies as "mandates" under League supervision.

**The consequence:** Nationalist movements worldwide, from Vietnam to Africa to the Middle East, learned that Western democracies wouldn't live up to their own ideals. Many turned to communism for support.

---

## ü§î Contemporary Parallels: The Echoes of Versailles

### Nation-Building Then and Now

Think about America's recent experiences with intervention and nation-building üèóÔ∏è:

**Iraq (2003-2011):** 
- Justified as spreading democracy
- Artificial state created by colonial powers
- Multiple ethnic/religious groups with historical conflicts
- Vast oil resources providing strategic motivation

**Afghanistan (2001-2021):**
- Twenty-year effort to build democratic institutions
- Complex tribal and ethnic divisions
- Strategic location between major powers
- Ultimate withdrawal leaving uncertain outcomes

**Libya (2011):**
- Intervention justified as protecting civilians
- Regime change resulting in ongoing chaos
- Strategic location and oil resources

**The Wilson Pattern:** Moral justification (democracy/human rights) combined with strategic interests, limited understanding of local complexities, mixed results.

### The Persistence of Arbitrary Borders

Many of today's conflicts trace directly to borders drawn at Versailles and similar conferences:

- **Middle East:** Syria, Iraq, Lebanon drawn by Europeans
- **Africa:** Arbitrary colonial borders ignore ethnic realities
- **Eastern Europe:** Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia both eventually fragmented along ethnic lines suppressed but not resolved
- **Balkans:** Wars of the 1990s had roots in borders drawn in 1919

<h3 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">üß† Critical Thinking Challenge</h3>
<p style="color: #e8e8e8; font-size: 1.1em;">Consider these modern situations through the Versailles lens:</p>
<ul style="color: #e8e8e8; line-height: 1.6;">
<li><strong>Should artificial states be maintained?</strong> Is it better to preserve existing borders despite internal conflicts, or allow ethnic/religious groups to form their own nations?</li>
<li><strong>When is intervention justified?</strong> How do we distinguish between genuine humanitarian concerns and strategic interests dressed up as moral causes?</li>
<li><strong>Can democracy be imposed?</strong> What are the prerequisites for democratic institutions to take root and survive?</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #ffd700; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 0;">How would you have handled these challenges differently?</p>
</div>

## üìù Reflection Questions: Learning from the Peace That Failed

As we conclude this trilogy on the Great War, consider these essential questions:

1. **The Intervention Paradox:** How did America's experience in Mexico shape its approach to global intervention? What patterns established there continue today?

2. **Idealism vs. Realpolitik:** Was Wilson naive to think moral principles could override national interests in international relations? Or was his vision simply ahead of its time?

3. **The Price of Victory:** Could the Allies have crafted a peace that didn't guarantee future war? What would you have done differently at Versailles?

4. **Artificial Nations:** Should the international community continue supporting artificial states created by colonial powers, or encourage ethnic/religious self-determination even if it means redrawing borders?

5. **The Democracy Paradox:** Why do efforts to spread democracy through force so often fail? What conditions are necessary for democratic institutions to succeed?

6. **Historical Patterns:** How many of today's international conflicts can be traced to decisions made at Versailles? What does this tell us about the long-term consequences of diplomatic decisions?

---

## üåü The Great War's Ultimate Legacy

We've journeyed from the collapse of the old European order through Russia's revolutionary transformation to America's emergence as a global power. But perhaps the most important lesson is this: **the Great War didn't end in 1918 - it paused**.

The unresolved tensions, economic devastation, and political resentments created by the peace settlement guaranteed that within twenty years, the world would be engulfed in an even more terrible conflict. World War II wasn't a separate war - it was **World War I: Part Two**.

**The tragic irony:** The "War to End All Wars" became the war that made the next war inevitable.

### The Mexican Mirror

America's experience in Mexico from 1914-1917 was its training ground for global hegemony. The lessons learned there - how to intervene, when to withdraw, how to justify action morally while pursuing strategic interests - became the template for American foreign policy for the next century.

Every time you see American forces deployed overseas "to protect democracy," remember that the pattern was established not in Europe, but in Mexico, by a president who genuinely believed he was making the world better.

### The Versailles Syndrome

The failure at Versailles teaches us that **peace is harder than war**. It's easier to destroy the old order than to build a just and lasting new one. The negotiators in Paris were dealing with forces they couldn't fully understand - nationalism, economic interdependence, the psychology of humiliation and revenge.

Their failure reminds us that good intentions aren't enough. Understanding history, respecting different cultures, and acknowledging the complexity of human societies are essential for anyone trying to shape the world.

---

**The haunting question:** As we face our own global challenges - climate change, economic inequality, technological disruption, rising nationalism - what lessons from this pivotal period should guide our decisions? How do we avoid repeating the mistakes of leaders who thought they were solving problems but were actually creating new ones?

---

*"The existence of the Soviet Republic alongside the imperialist states over the long run is unthinkable. In the end, either the one or the other will triumph."* - Lenin, 1919

*"We are running away from honor. We are breaking the heart of the world."* - Wilson, on America's rejection of the League of Nations

---

**Series Conclusion:** From the sophisticated peace system of 1814 to the catastrophic stalemate of 1917, from the Russian Revolution to American global emergence, we've witnessed how the modern world was forged in the crucible of total war. The choices made between 1914-1921 shaped the entire twentieth century and continue to influence our world today. The Great War may have ended, but its consequences echo still.

# The Great War, Part II: Glossary

## Key Terms and Concepts

### **Armistice**
A formal agreement to stop fighting; a truce. The WWI Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918, at 6 AM but didn't take effect until 11 AM, resulting in unnecessary casualties during those final five hours.

### **Article 231 (War Guilt Clause)**
The section of the Treaty of Versailles that forced Germany to accept full responsibility for causing WWI and all resulting damages. This created deep resentment in Germany that extremists later exploited.

### **Black Jack Pershing**
General John J. Pershing, commander of American forces in Mexico (1916-1917) and later in Europe during WWI. His experience chasing Pancho Villa in Mexico prepared him for European command.

### **Cient√≠ficos**
Porfirio D√≠az's advisors in Mexico who believed in applying "scientific" methods to governance - imposing order first, then achieving progress through modernization, with liberty coming last (if at all).

### **Clemenceau, Georges**
French Prime Minister during WWI and at the Paris Peace Conference. Known as "The Tiger," he wanted harsh punishment for Germany to ensure French security.

### **Collective Security**
The principle that an attack on one nation should be considered an attack on all, with international organizations coordinating the response. This was a key concept behind Wilson's League of Nations.

### **Devil Dogs (Teufelhunden)**
Alleged German nickname for U.S. Marines after their fierce fighting at the Battle of Belleau Wood in 1918. Whether Germans actually used this term is debated, but it became part of Marine Corps legend.

### **D√≠az, Porfirio**
Mexican dictator who ruled from 1876-1910 during the "Porfiriato." His policies modernized Mexico's economy but benefited foreign investors while impoverishing most Mexicans.

### **Diktat**
German term for an imposed settlement or harsh terms dictated by the victor. Germans viewed the Treaty of Versailles as a diktat rather than a negotiated peace.

### **Fourteen Points**
President Wilson's idealistic plan for post-war peace, including principles like open diplomacy, free trade, self-determination, and the League of Nations. Most points were compromised or abandoned at Versailles.

### **Huerta, Victoriano**
Mexican general who overthrew the democratically elected Francisco Madero in 1913. Wilson refused to recognize his government, leading to U.S. intervention in Mexico.

### **Hundred Days Offensive**
The final Allied offensive of WWI (August-November 1918) that broke through German lines and forced the armistice. American troops played a crucial role in this decisive campaign.

### **League of Nations**
Wilson's proposed international organization designed to prevent future wars through collective security and diplomacy. The U.S. never joined due to Senate opposition.

### **Lloyd George, David**
British Prime Minister during WWI and at the Paris Peace Conference. He sought to balance punishing Germany with maintaining the British Empire and naval supremacy.

### **Lodge, Henry Cabot**
Republican Senator who led opposition to U.S. joining the League of Nations, fearing it would entangle America in foreign conflicts and compromise national sovereignty.

### **Madero, Francisco**
Idealistic Mexican leader who challenged D√≠az's dictatorship and briefly served as president (1911-1913) before being overthrown and killed in a military coup supported by foreign powers.

### **Mandates**
Territories taken from defeated powers in WWI and placed under League of Nations supervision, supposedly to prepare them for independence. In practice, they were often disguised colonies.

### **Mexican Revolution**
Complex civil war (1910-1920) that overthrew D√≠az's dictatorship but involved multiple factions fighting for control. It became America's laboratory for learning intervention techniques.

### **Missionary Diplomacy**
Wilson's approach to foreign policy based on promoting American democratic values and moral principles worldwide, often through intervention.

### **National Self-Determination**
The principle that peoples should have the right to choose their own government and form their own nations. Wilson promoted this idea, but it was selectively applied mainly to European peoples.

### **Pan o Palo**
Spanish phrase meaning "bread or the stick" - D√≠az's policy of rewarding compliance while using violence against dissent. It became a model for authoritarian control throughout Latin America.

### **Porfiriato**
The period of Porfirio D√≠az's rule in Mexico (1876-1910), characterized by economic modernization, political repression, and foreign exploitation of Mexican resources.

### **Punitive Expedition**
The U.S. military campaign (1916-1917) led by General Pershing to capture Pancho Villa after his raid on Columbus, New Mexico. It failed to catch Villa but taught America lessons about military intervention.

### **Realpolitik**
Practical politics based on national interests and power rather than moral principles or ideological considerations. European leaders at Versailles practiced realpolitik while Wilson promoted idealism.

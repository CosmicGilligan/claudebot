I know what I want but I just don't know how to go about giving Feeling, sweet feeling Drops from my fingers, fingers. Manic depressions captured my soul yeah. Warm heart so with it the sweet calls in pain me. You make love, you break love it all the same when it's, it's over. Music, sweet music I wish I could caress, caress, caress. Manic depression is a frustrating m. Wow, Sam. Well, I think I've turned myself off and I go on down all the way down. Really ain't no use to me hanging around you're kind of. Sweet music Sweet music I wish I could caress in a kiss Frustrating mess. Wow, Sam. See, you thought that modern music was loud and obnoxious. Can you guys hear me? See? Yes. You can't hear me. Okay. Because I can't hear myself. But that's. That's okay. So how are you guys doing? Did you guys like my song? Yeah, I like that song. What. What band is. Was. Jimmy. Jimmy, man. Oh, yeah. So do you know. That's all right. Do you know why I played that song today? Anybody want to guess? The name of the song was Manic Depression. Yeah, we're talking about the depression. Okay. Which actually was a worldwide thing. So any. Any questions or comments? You guys are all good. You're happy Thanksgiving. You wish it was longer, but we're almost done. Actually, you only got like two, three weeks left. And if you guys are all working on your projects. Right. Okay. Don't let that slide. It's. It's actually a good exercise for you guys, I think. Let me go ahead and show you. This is our canvas page. I want you to notice that I actually put an extra credit. I don't know if you guys got it over the. Over the holiday. It's not due until a week from Thursday, but where did I put it? Right here. So this is going to be. There's actually two sections in there. The first section is the series of questions, and the second section is to watch a video. The video is actually a really. It's not a good video because it's like a History channel, poorly produced kind of quality video. But the story is really compelling. So I think that you would really get a lot of maybe inspiration from the. From the video. So if you watch the video, answer these questions, then you can get up to 15 points of extra credit. So. So if you're behind on something and. Or you just want to, you know, get the extra credit points, just, you know, you can go ahead and do that with this. So any questions, comments, about any of this. I. I noticed this morning that nobody had done it, but that doesn't mean nobody's going to do it. You've got over a week to do it. All right, so anything that I can help you with before we get started? Everybody's good. I think somebody put in the chat discussing a little more of the project. Okay. Do you want. Ryan, do you want me to talk about something that everybody would be interested in or just you? Just me. Can you hear me all right? My mic has been having issues. Yeah, I can hear you. No, it's okay. You should hang out after the class and I'll talk to you. Cool. All right, so let me go ahead and show you the slide set again. And. All right, so today we're going to talk about the period between World War I and World War II. The last thing we ended up with last week or the week before last, before we went on break, was the Treaty of Versailles, the Versailles Conference, and the outcome of that. And we talked about how that had very. Had a lot of negative consequences, which we still experience today. One of the things we didn't talk about, but is actually part of it, is the Great Depression. That was a worldwide depression that happened after World War I. And the thing about the Great Depression is that because of the political contest, I guess you could say, between liberals and socialists and communists, Marxists and all these other people, there's different ways of explaining what actually happened, depending on your political point of view. And I want to kind of try to avoid that and just point to some facts that lead to what will be the Great Depression. So that's where we're going to go ahead and start. And when we start, we want to start with World War I. Okay. And what happens in World War I is actually, for the first three years of the war, the United States wasn't in it. And we had two sides, Britain and France on one side, Germany and Austria on the other. But these countries here are the major industrial countries of the world at this time. And Britain, well, actually, all of the contestants ran out of money after about a year. But because rather than giving up fighting the war because they couldn't afford it, they went ahead and continued, and Germany went deeper and deeper into debt. And Britain and France, also Britain and France actually ended up borrowing lots of money from banks in the United States. Okay. And again, this is before the US Was involved in the war. One of the things that that tells us is that that old canard about war is good for the economy is actually a lie because what we see from this is that wars terrible for the economy. That war actually destroys the economy. And the reason why is because you're destroying the national property, right? So when Britain and Britain is borrowing money from US Banks to build war machines that are going to be destroyed, it would be kind of like one of us going down to the car dealership and buying a $40,000 SUV and driving it off the end of the pier, right? It would. It may be fun, but it would be very expensive. And that's what happened in this case. Britain and France borrowed all this money and they were on the hook basically to pay it back at the end of the war. All right, because they didn't owe it to the U.S. they owed it to U.S. banks. All right, you guys are with me. Questions, Comments about this. But that's more. Sure. Is that. Because it's more. That's true if you're fighting on home soil, but if you're fighting overseas, then it's a different look, Right? Because you're not destroying besides the military stuff you're using. You're not destroying your infrastructure and all that like they did, actually fighting because it was on home soil. You're going to have more of a damage and lose more money. Well, that's true. The only problem, I mean, it's probably not to the same extent, except that you're still destroying the national property because like, for example, the country's buying these weapons and they're being destroyed or they're deliberately blowing them up. Right? So that's like throwing money away essentially. Right. So it may not be to the same extent in a country where the armies, where the military is on another country's soil, but it's still destroying money. The only people actually make money from a war are the people who provide goods for the military. So arms manufacturers and people like that are the ones who make the money. The rest of the country itself is going to suffer. One of the things that you'll notice from studying history is that after every war there's a depression. Think about that. Right after everybody, constant war. Why is that? Well, yeah, you gotta. It's like saying, avoid hangovers, stay drunk. Right. Okay. All right. Okay. So let's go back then. Now, you guys, I don't know if I remember, if I don't. If I did, if I said this when we talked about the Versailles Conference and the Versailles Treaty, the Treaty of Versailles was the treaty with Germany. But one of the major kind of consequences of that treaty was that Germany was forced to admit that it was fully responsible for the war, and therefore it was fully responsible for all the costs of the war. And that meant that Germany was basically required to pay what were called reparations to Britain and France for all the money that they had lost during the war, all the money that they had spent to fight the war. Okay. And when Germany agreed to this, the Allies said, well, we'll tell you how much it is later. And when they did tell him, it was enormous amount. And really the whole point of it wasn't necessarily to pay for the war. It was to punish Germany to cripple its economy so that it could not be a threat. Again, that was the idea behind it. All right, so now after the war, then Britain and France owe money to the United States or to banks in the United States, and Germany owes money to Britain and France, but all of their economies have been devastated by the war. And so Britain and France then, because they owe this money to American banks, will demand that Germany start to pay its reparations. And if it doesn't, they threaten to invade. Okay, so Germany then is stuck between a rock and a hard place because it's on the hook to pay money, but it doesn't have any money. And if you don't have any money and you have to pay money, what do you do? Well, you can steal it, but there's no way to steal it on the international scale. So the Germans actually borrowed money. And if you're going to borrow money in this situation, who are you going to borrow it from? Well, all of the money basically in the world was in the US Economy, right? So what happens is that because the United States is not part of the Versailles Treaty, then Germany, the US Passes laws that make it possible for American banks to lend money to Germany. So there we have American banks lending money to Germany, who then use that money to pay reparations to Britain and France, who use that money to pay back war payments, war loan payments to the United States. You guys are all following me here. So we have basically a cycle of money here going across the Atlantic. But the thing is, where is all this money coming from? And all the money is coming from what's called a bull market in the United States. The stock market basically is a way of speculating on the value of things that are being traded. And a bull market, in a bull market, the value, the prices and the value continue to go up. And as they go up, that means that more and more wealth is being created. So, so, so basically then the bull market is creating a lot of wealth in the U.S. economy. And the U.S. is using that. U.S. banks essentially are using that money to keep this kind of cycle, this cycle going across the Atlantic. But the thing that you need to really keep in mind here is that this is a cycle of debt. People paying off debts, right? So this cycle of debt then is being kept afloat by the American bull market. And that's why you see in the background this balloon, it's like a hot air balloon. And the hot air is the wealth that's being created by the bull market. Okay. The reason why I drew it this way is because the wealth that is being created by the bull market isn't all real. It's speculation. And I'm going to show you how that works in the next few pictures. And so what I did was I created some slides, some actual. Some pictures right on my. Whatever this is Photoshop. Right? And what we'll see here, what I'm going to. I'm going to explain to you is the idea of trading on margin and how that leads to the stock market crash. All right? So if we look at the stock market and keep in mind that all of the numbers I'm making up here are just examples, except for the dates. Right? So when you look at the stock market, you have to consider two different values. One of them is price. The other one is value. Right. The price is what I should say the other way around. Value is what people. What the stock is actually worth. Price is what people are willing to pay for the stock. And price and value rarely are equal on the stock market because the stock market is driven by speculation, and speculation can inflate the prices of stock or deflate the prices of stock. All right, but in the 1920s, what was happening was that the. The value of the stock was rising at a certain rate, but the prices were rising at enormous rate. Okay, so you have the value of the stock rising at, you know, a constant steady rate. But the bull market, basically what this really means is that people are willing to pay more for the stock than it's actually worth, because that's. I don't know why that's the way the stock market works. I'm actually a historian, not. Not an economist, obviously. But at any rate, what happens then in about 1927, people start to realize they're paying too much for these stocks, and the stock market kind of levels out. And then in 1929, what happens is that there's what they call a market correction. And the market correction is when the price will move to meet the value. And so basically what happens is that this inflated price that people were paying for stocks all of a sudden drops to what the value of the stock actually is. And you would say that shouldn't help them, right? Except for the problem of this money in here, right? This money in here was money that was speculated. Was speculated money. It wasn't real money, right? So whenever, when the stock market crashed, all that money was gone. All right, what money is that money? That money is imaginary, right? I don't know if you guys. You probably don't remember back to 2008, when we had the housing crisis and the financial crisis that went along with it. The problem there was that people were paying way too much for houses than they were actually worth. And at some point, that situation was no longer sustainable. So the prices of the houses fell to meet the value of the houses, and all of that money that was in there was lost. So you could hear on the radio any given day, oh, $7 billion was lost off the stock market today. Right? And then you have to wonder, well, how can people lose $7 billion on the stock market? And the answer is, you can't if it's real. But it wasn't real. It was speculative. All right, so let me just show you how this works. You have to kind of imagine this because I can't draw it on a board, right? But imagine the idea. In fact, I do have a slide about that, I think. Let me just go look here. Right here. Let's go to this slide, right? Trading on margin. Oops. That's not what I wanted to do. This is what I wanted to do. Okay? So what happens is that people can buy stocks. Trading on margin means that people can buy stocks for less than the value of the stock, right? So basically then we're going to say, if you look at this picture, that the amount of money that they're using to buy the stock, say, is $10, okay? And the amount of money that they're getting in stock is a hundred dollars, right? Just making all this up, it's not real money, but wasn't real money then either. But the point here is that it just giving you an idea how it works. Okay? So you put up $10 and then you get certificates that say you have $100. Right. In some ways, it's a lot like buying a car or something like that. You put money down and you get the car, but it's not really your car. You still have to pay for it. Right? The way that this works in the stock market is the idea is that you can put up a small amount of money in a bull market and that once that investment has been made, the prices on the bull market will continue to rise until the difference between or the margin between the amount of money you put down and the amount of money you got will disappear and all that money will be yours. Right? You follow what I'm saying here? Okay, so now let's think about this for a minute. We put down $10 and we got $100 worth of stock. And that $100 is $100 that we can use, right? We can use the whole hundred dollars. All right? How much money do we actually have? None, unless you pull it. It's actually, it's not even none, it's less than none. You have $90 worth of debt, right? On the day you buy, the day that you make this transaction, you don't have $100. You have minus $90 because you owe $90 on this debt. You follow what I'm saying here? But you can still use this as real money, right? So if you're a bank and you have a lot of this, then you can use this money and lend it to Germany, right? So what that means is then that the United States banks are paying money to Germany. That's not real money, right? That's why when you looked at my picture that I had there, you had. That's why when you looked at the picture, the whole thing, or actually the other picture, where's it at? Right here. The whole thing is actually, is actually kept intact by the bull market. As long as the market prices are going up, then the amount of money that's available to lend is going to be there, even if it's not real money. You follow what I'm saying? But here's what happened when you went through the market correction, which we call it the crash, right? And the money that was lent disappears, essentially. That's why when I look at the great debt balloon here, what happens with the great debt balloon is that when the fire goes out, the balloon crashes. And that's what we see happening. What happens then is that the market crashes. The whole thing comes down and that's going to destroy the industrial enemies. And here's why. If we look at what happened when the banks. Let's wait a minute. Where am I at here? Is it just one? Yes, this one. All right, so you get how the trading on margin works, right? Okay, so now what happens is that when the banks lose all the money that they had been spending, that they had been Lending that money. Where does that money come from? Where does the money that the bank has to buy on margin come from? It's coming from. Do they just pick it off? English? The English and French paying us back. Well, that's part of it, but where does it come from originally? What do you guys use a bank for? Oh, you mean. So the American money. I mean, you use a bank for what? To put your money in. Right. The idea behind a bank, generally most people put their money in there. Most people probably don't have savings accounts now, but they did then. Right. And also, even your checking accounts nowadays pay interest. Why does the bank pay you interest on the money that you put in the bank? The reason why is because when you put that money in the bank, you're allowing them to use that money. Right? So when people were depositing money in the bank in the 1920s, they were allowing the banks to use that money, and the banks use that money to buy on margin so that they could have an inflated value, inflated amount of money to lend in this kind of system, this kind of hot air of debt. Okay, and when the stock market crashed and all that money disappeared, what happened to the bank's money? The bank was loaning essentially 10 times more than it actually had. So what happens when all that money disappears? Let's say you got money in the bank. What happens to your money? It's gone. It's gone. Exactly. So what happens then is that people are not stupid. They realize, okay, the bank has just lost all my money, so I better run down there and get as much as I can before it's. Before it's all gone. And that's called a run on the bank. Right. So there's what. What happens is that there's runs on the banks in really the United States is what we're really talking about here. And when the people. What. What happens is people go down to the bank, they stand in line, they draw, withdraw all their money, and then once the bank runs out of money, you're the next guy in line. And what happens to you? You're out of luck. Right? You're on the road. You are basically, I just say it nicely, out of luck. All right, so what happens then is that the banks actually end up closing. Many of the banks end up closing. Right. And the problem with that in an industrial economy is that. Or I should say it this way, the problem with that in a capitalist economy is that where the capital comes from is from the bank. When you're talking about industry, the way that industry Works is that the industry will. The corporation will purchase machinery to build things by labor, by materials. And all the money that is used to do that, the money for the. For the labor, the machines and the materials, are all from money borrowed from the bank. And then what happens is that they make the product and they sell the product. And the amount of money they get from selling the product will be enough to pay back the bank, and it will also be a profit. Right? That's the way it works. Okay, but if there isn't any money, if there isn't any bank, then the corporations can't make anything. If the corporations can't make anything, then they can't sell anything. And if. If they can't sell anything, then people don't have jobs. And this is what causes a Great depression, Right, the Great Depression. The basic idea behind the Great depression is that the capital dried up, right? There was no capital. And you cannot have capitalism without capital. All right, you guys are with me here. If you want to have capitalism, you have to have capital. And the way that you get the capital is from the bank. If the bank is gone, if it's closed, then you can't get capital, right? And that means that industry will collapse. And that's what happens. Industry. Throughout the industrial war, I mean, the industries of Britain, France and Germany were already destroyed. And the industrial economies of the United States and Japan will also collapse at the same time, which then will lead to a worldwide financial crisis. Because the countries I was just talking about, Britain, France, Germany, the United States and Japan, are all members of what particular group of countries that I talked about having to do with dependency theory? You guys remember dependency theory? There were the two circles. One was the modernized economy and the other one was the colonized economy. Remember we talked about the challenge of the 19th century, the challenge of modernization, right? Modernize or be colonized. Which group of countries are Japan, United States, Germany, France and England in imperial. Modernized. Yeah, the metropolis. The metropolis, exactly. Metropolis. Remember we talked about the prop. The metropolis and the periphery. Right, the modernized economies. All right, so if the modernized economies collapse, what happens to the dependent economies? If, for example, the cotton industry in England collapses, what happens to the Indian economy that provides the cotton? It also collapses because it also collapses. Right? So Basically then, by 1932 or 1933, the industrial economy of the world had collapsed, right? The only country, really the only major country whose economy did not collapse during this period of time was the Soviet Union. Does anybody want to guess why the Soviet Union's economy didn't collapse? Well, I should say it the other way. Why did the economy of the Soviet Union not collapse when all of the capitalist economies collapsed? Russia was, was not involved in capitalism. Right. They were communists. Right. And that's what they'll tell you. And so the, the kind of the, the, the propaganda that came from this after the great, or during the Great Depression from the Soviet Union was, well, see all you guys, economy collapsed and ours didn't. And that means that communism works. And a lot of people, a lot of very smart people will start to look at socialism and communism during the 1930s as maybe a good idea. Right. The problem with that propaganda was that the Russian economy had collapsed during the civil war, during the revolution and the civil war, and it had never recovered. Right. So the biggest reason why it didn't collapse is because it couldn't collapse. It had already collapsed. Right. So their propaganda was, was kind of a lie, but a lot of people bought it anyway. Right? All right, so we're kind of done with how we get into the Great Depression. Questions, Comments about this. All right, so now here's the problem. We're, we're in a situation where people all over the world don't have things and they need things. Right. I don't think anybody here has ever been in a situation where we were without food, without money, without resources, and with no prospect of a future. Right. I really don't think any of us have been there, but I could be wrong, but this is the way it was for millions of people around the world that they didn't have anything, they didn't have the things they needed. Right? And what it does is it creates a lot of, a lot of migration. People will be leaving the places where they are to try to find a better place where they can get, you know, a better opportunity. This is, I, if you guys are familiar with US History, this is when all, a lot of the people from the Midwest will move to the west coast because they're looking for more opportunities. So huge migration happening in countries and between countries Right? Now, before I start talking about how people try to solve these problems, I want to do a little detour through isms. And you're saying what's isms and isms is different kinds of governments that people put together. Okay? So I want to just go in a real high level way through this and keeping in mind the problem with the definition of any of these things like liberalism, communism, socialism, is that it depends on who's talking as to what it means. For example, we could say socialism and then you could say, oh, Venezuela, right? And then in Venezuela, Venezuela is extremely poor because they've essentially mismanaged their economy, right? And you could say, well see, socialism is bad, right? Or you could look at some place like anywhere in Europe really, particularly the north, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, right? And say, well, these are socialist countries and they provide a lot of value to their citizens and the citizens are happy, right? So it depends on if you're pro socialist, then you can look at that and say, well see, socialism works, right? Or if you're anti socialism, then you can say, look at Venezuela, that doesn't work. And then basically you have used the same word to describe two different things, right? Same thing with democracy, right? So for example, in the United States, it's not part of our name, but the United States is theoretically a beacon for democracy, right? But the, I'm not sure if you know this, but the official name of North Korea is the Democratic Republic of North Korea, right? Well, the United States is democracy. Korea says it's a democracy. Are they the same? You see what I'm saying? So the problem then with using these words is you have to put them, you have to make sure you're using them in the context or you're defining the context you're using them in. Does that make sense? All right, so let's go on. Liberalism, we've already talked, we've been kind of talking about is this kind of conglomeration of democracy, secularism and capitalism that came out of the Enlightenment. It was really the precursor of communism because the idea behind liberalism was that once the, the monarchy and the church had been swept aside, it would liberate mankind to create their own paradise. Right? They wouldn't need God or the state to do it. And, and that's what theoretical communism actually says, right? Theoretical communism says that after you have the revolution of the proletariat, then there will be no need for a state anymore and everybody will just be happy living in their workers paradise. All right? That's the theory. The actual truth is that communism really has never been implemented anywhere in the world. Okay? Not theoretical communism, all right? So what they end up with is state control over industry and labor. And then they also end up being very coercive because people, after a while, people realize that working for nothing is not very, very valuable to them and they'd rather not do it. So the state has to work them into it. Okay, so communism then has never really been tried and it never really, what they call communism today isn't really theoretical communism. Leave it at that, okay, we can go into it much more than that, but we don't need to. Okay? So now when we talk about socialism, that's why I put more or less democratic socialism, either more democratic, like in the case of, say, Sweden, or less democratic, like in the case of, say, Cuba. Right? Okay. More or less democratic. Right. And what that means is that the countries can be, on the one hand, the kind of more one is where the government takes control of major industries. Like in, for example, in England, the railroads are all owned by the government. The health care is all owned by the government. That's true in almost all of the European countries. Right. And then also that the government is responsible for social welfare. So what that means is that the government essentially directs the output of an economy to the welfare of the people through taxation. All right? And that's why, for example, if you go to Germany, get a free college education, free health care, right? Subsidized housing, all these different things, but you pay 60 to 70% in taxes. Right? You follow what I'm saying here? Questions, comments about this? Okay, so that's basically socialism, the way it's practiced today, right? Corporatism is another kind of form of government that arose out of kind of during the Depression or maybe a little before. We're looking at. It really starts in Italy, right, With what they call fascism, right? Fascism is based on a Roman symbol, the fasci. The fasci was the symbol of the Roman state. It's like a bunch of sticks tied together. And when it's tied together like that, it becomes very strong. You can't break it. Okay? So sorry, so that's where the word fascism comes from. They. The system of fascism basically is that there's one single party in the country and that party controls all of the major segments of society. Right? So if we think about. In most societies, you'll have liberals, you have conservatives, you have industrialists, you have workers, you have intellectuals, you have the military, right? These are all the different parts of society, or what we would call the corporations, the bodies of society, right? So in a single party state, in a corporate state, one party manages the difference between those groups, okay? Now if you look at, for example, in a country like the United States, in a democracy, right? All those different groups manage their own affairs and the conflict between them is worked out in the ballot boxes, right? That we go to the polls and we vote for in the interest of whatever segment that we want to support. Right? But in a corporatist economy, it's all done by the party the people are not really. They don't really get to choose anything. Okay. Now, the rest of these are not really forms of government, but they're aspects of government. So we've probably heard of populism. It's interesting. In the United States, Bernie Sanders is called a populist. Donald Trump was also called a populist. Right. Well, what does that mean? It means that. That they both appeal to the interests of the common man. Okay. But there's two different kinds of populism. There's democratic populism or authoritarian populism. Democratic populism is that we all together communally will make a difference, will do for the good of everybody. And that's where you can see that kind of. In socialist ideas, unions, things like that. Right. Authoritarian populism is where there's one strong man. The one strong man is going to fix everything for everybody. And that's what you see with, you know, the, the Nazis, with the fascists and the, the phalanges and other people that I'll talk about here in a couple minutes. Right. So. But populism is going to be very, very significant because if you are a populist leader and you get the support of the common people, then the law essentially can go out the window, basically. You can do whatever you want and the people support it. So. So there's no consequence. Okay. And that's what you see happening with, for example, with Hitler. Right. Hitler was, Was a populist because he really did well for the. Basically, they had zero unemployment in Germany before the war started. In Germany. In Germany. Right. So. So the people were happy. We said, we like this guy, the Fuhrer. He's. He's our guy. Right? But the problem was then that he had the ability to overrule the rule of law, essentially. And that led to the downfall. Right, Let me go back to corporatism just a minute. Because talking about that is that there's also two different kind of ways of thinking about corporatism. And the most common way is to associate the party with a single individual. Right? So we associate fascism with Mussolini and we associate Nazism with Hitler, and we associate Falanges with Francisco Franco in Spain. And when those people are gone, the party is also gone. And that's going to be the normal case. But there's one instance where the party was not centered on one individual. And so it actually lasted for a long period of time. We'll talk about that in a minute. Questions? Comments about this? So authoritarianism, again, is kind of like the idea that it doesn't have to be populist. Authoritarianism can be imposed on people as well, but it really means rule by a single agent. So, for example, you can say China calls itself communist. It's not really communist, but it really is authoritarian because it's being ruled by the party. Okay. And the party essentially is being ruled by. By Xi. Right. I think that's the same Xi. Anyway, so then militarism is ruled by the military. You see that a lot in some other countries, like African countries or Latin American countries. And that was really the rule in Japan before World War II. We don't really see that in the United States. And there's good reason for that, but we'll kind of go on past that. Oligarchy means ruled by the wealthy elite, monarchy obviously ruled by a monarch, and the theocracy is ruled by religious authorities. Right. So there's a kind of a basic rundown of isms that we talk about. A lot of times I think we talk about these things, but we don't really know what we're talking about when we do, because there's many ways to look at it. So I don't know if this is helpful or not. What do you guys think? Does that help at all to look at these different things? Or did you guys pretty much already know all this? That's always helpful to go back over those things. Yeah. All right, so. And in this picture, basically it's a political spectrum. And you can see that political spectrum basically has been busted. So this is all going to change really rapidly, I think. Anyway, so now let's talk about how do people respond to the Great Depression? And this is where you play a little word game where you take the word desperate and you put it in this sentence. People search for solutions. Right? You could say, desperate people search for solutions, or you could say people desperately search for solutions, or people search for desperate solutions. Right. And all three of those are correct. Right. So, for example, it was the stresses of the Great Depression that drove Italy, Germany, Spain into fascism, Nazism and Falangeism. Falanges doesn't have the kind of negative baggage that fascism and Nazism do because of the fact that they never really set out on a project of world conquest. Right. We also see this in Latin America, particularly Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Right. So in Argentina they had Peronismo and what time is it? Yeah, I think I'm going to skip. There's an eight minute video here that talks about Peronismo. But if you think about what I said about corporatism and then you look at this video, you'll see how this is a prime example of corporatism. Right? And then in Brazil they had the Estado Novo, which was associated with. And in Mexico they have the Pre. Now the Pre is no longer in power, but the Pre was in power from about 1920 until the year 2000. So it was one of the, it was probably the most successful of these corporatist governments. All right, I'm not saying that the Pre was Nazi. Okay, what I'm saying, or the same as Nazis, but what I'm saying is that all of the conflicts in society in Mexico between the different segments of society were worked out by the party. One of the things you can do, if you look at the history of Mexico in the 20th century, you can see that they had liberal governments and they had conservative governments and they had middle of the road governments, but they were all the Pre. Right. So all of those different, all those different contests, I guess you could say, between the different segments of society were being worked out inside the party and not at the ballot box. And one of the biggest reasons for that historically in Mexico is that when they went to work out their differences at the ballot box, they ended up shooting at each other. So this was a way of keeping the peace and also, also, you know, managing the interests of the different segments of society. And I think that's one of the reasons, the main reason why the Pre lasted longer than any of these others is because it wasn't associated with a single individual. Right. That in Mexico they have a saying, God dies every six years. Right. So when whoever's president is president, they have a lot of power, but once their six years is up, they're gone and somebody else takes that power. And they might be of a completely different persuasion politically. That's happened many times in Mexican history. Right. But the main thing is, up until 2000, the PRE actually was in complete control of Mexico. All right, questions, Comments about this? All right, so anyway, kind of a, A kind of a detour and then militarism in Japan, what happens is that Japan was starting to democratize. And when you watch that movie Meiji, you could see that. But what happens is that the depression causes, you know, a downturn, collapse essentially of the Japanese economy. And the way that they try to overcome that is by invading China. We see socialism in Europe, different, varying degrees of socialism. So we could say basically every European country with the exception of Germany, Italy and Spain became socialist during the 1920s. And most of them are still socialist today to a Certain extent. Right. Which means that the government controls industries and has its hand in the economy more than you would say in the United States with what we call laissez faire. All right? And then you already had communism in the Soviet Union. And the United States does a different kind of. It takes a different kind of direction, I guess you could say, in trying to solve the problem of the Depression. Because what happens in all these other places and essentially everywhere in the world is that liberalism is abandoned. The idea of democracy, secularism, capitalism is abandoned everywhere in the world except in the United States. In the United States, the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, institutes what's called the New Deal with the express purpose of saving capitalism. Right. That capitalism essentially had failed everywhere else. Right? And Roosevelt was very concerned about saving capitalism. So by the time we get to the 1938, 1939, the beginning of World War II, the only really liberal country left in the world was the United States. Okay? The only real capitalist country in the world was the United States, and that's because of the New Deal. All right, questions, comments about any of this? You guys are all following me here. All right, almost done. Now, I don't want to go through that right now. What we want to do is take a look at how this kind of plays out in the international arena in the 1930s, particularly, right? 1920s, 1930s, but mostly the 1930s. And what happens is that after World War I, Americans decided to turn their back on the world, right? That after that, the Americans had a tradition of isolationism, that the United States had a tradition of not getting involved in the affairs of other countries. Other than what I mean by that is European countries, particularly, because Americans did intervene a lot in Latin America, as I pointed out to you guys. But Americans were not involved among the great powers. And after World War I, the United States essentially encodes that in law. The United States passes a number of what they call neutrality acts. Partially, these neutrality acts were to keep the American President from getting the United States involved in another war, right? Because Wilson had promised not to get the United States involved in a war, and yet he did, and the United States had won the war. But when everybody came back in the 1920s, there was a depression, right? And Americans said that was a stupid mistake. We shouldn't have that war. We shouldn't have done that, and we're going to be neutral. And one of the other things that happens in the 1930s when Roosevelt is president is that the Congress is often controlled by Republicans, and Republicans don't want Roosevelt to get the United States involved in a war in Europe or anywhere else for that matter. So they passed these neutrality acts. All right. Well, the problem with that from, from a world standpoint, is that the, The. The only other institution, I guess you could say, that was interested in world peace was the League of Nations. And the League of Nations, because the United States wasn't in, it was basically a paper tiger. There was nothing. It had no real authority at all. Right, so what happens then is that Japan, as I've already mentioned to you, had decided that the way to overcome their depression was by invading the. The Asian mainland, first Manchuria and then China. And again, the reason why they're doing this is not because they want to rule those countries necessarily, but because that's a way to get resources for their economy. Like the British and the French, they didn't have resources at home to get their. To get their. For their industry. So what they were trying to do was to annex enough of the Pacific in order to be able to support their industrial plan. So they invade Manchuria and then they invade Korea. And then they start to put pressure on Southeast Asia, at which point the United States will basically, already economic rivals are going to. Are going to start to warn the Japanese about their expansionist policies because they're afraid of what would happen. The United States at that time still owned the Philippine Islands. Right. Let me just say before I go on that when Japan started on this. On this campaign of conquest, the League of Nations did nothing. Right? And that's going to be a signal to others that, hey, the League of Nations is nothing. We can do whatever we want. Right. We'll see how that works here in a few minutes. But at any rate, eventually what's going to happen is that the United States, although the United States is a rival economic rival of Japan, the United States also provides raw materials to Japan, and Japan needs those raw materials in order to be able to operate its industrial plant. So imports from America are very important to Japan's industry. And what happens is that the United States, as Japan continues its aggression in Asia, the United States will warn the Japanese that they will cut off the flow of materials to Japan if they continue. And Japan basically continues to the point that Roosevelt cuts off American exports to Japan. At which point then the Japanese decide, well, the best thing to do now is to just take over everything we need all at once. And they devise this plan to conquer the Pacific Ocean essentially in one fell swoop. So their idea is that they're going to extend their empire to all these places. And their strategy essentially was, well, we're going to do that. And then because everybody in the world is sick of war, nobody wants a war, we'll just say, okay, we're done. We're not going to do anymore. And because the United States isn't going to do anything, they're in the middle of depression and they're neutral. They've got neutrality acts. They won't do anything. So we'll just get away with it. We'll just basically present it to the world as a fait accompli. That was their plan. Right. But they thought, well, just in case the United States has some funny ideas about getting involved, why don't we just bomb their fleet at Pearl harbor at the beginning of this campaign? And that way they won't be able to respond if they want to. And you say, well, that's kind of a weird plan. But keep in mind that that was how they started the Russo Japanese War in 1905 as well, with the bombardment of the surprise attack on the Russian fleet. Okay, so here we see a surprise attack on the American fleet. But their plan of knocking the US out of the war turned out to be a fantasy because Americans were roused to great anger after Pearl Harbor. All right, and so that's going to be what leads to the war in the Pacific. All right, but you can see how that all starts with the Depression. All right, questions? Comments about this? All right, let's go back to the other side of the world now and look at Europe. You guys will remember that after World War I, Germany was divided up between Germany and East Prussia. Some parts of Germany were given back to France, and other parts of Germany were occupied by the French. And then other parts that had once been part of Germany had been made into another country called Czechoslovakia, and Austria was made into a country. And this was a blow to the pride of the German nation. Essentially, the Germans felt that they had been betrayed by the Treaty of Versailles, and they felt that they had been betrayed by the people who negotiated that treaty, which was the Weimar Republic. And because a number of officers in the Weimar government were Jewish, there was a man you guys probably all heard of, Adolf Hitler, who was. Who was able to blame Germany's. What's the word I'm looking for? Humiliation at the feet of the Jews. Right. Now, keep in mind that there was a long history of antisemitism in Europe. So Hitler didn't invent antisemitism, but he was able to use it to his advantage. And what he did was he was able to convince these desperate people in Germany that the Jews were all to blame for. And he wrote he was put in prison. He had a little kind of a putsch, I guess you could say that's what they call it, but the beer hall putsch. I don't speak German, so I'm not sure that's right. But anyway, the point here is that, is that he was put in prison. And while he was in prison, he wrote a book. And the name of the book was Mein Kampf. And in this book he laid out what he thought was the best plan for Germany, which was to first off repudiate the Treaty of Versailles, take back all their land, rebuild their military, and then consolidate all of the German speaking peoples of Europe into one country, which would be called Greater Germany. And then to invade the east, because the east there was a lot of oil and there was a lot of agricultural territory here that could be used for the German people. So from Hitler's racist point of view, the German people were the pinnacle of civilization. And the people that lived in the East Slavic peoples, Poles, were all intermission, less than human, lower humans. And as a result of that, they didn't deserve this land. And so what would happen would be that after the greater German nation had been consolidated, they would invade the east to acquire Lebensraum. Lebensraum is living space, right? That the German nation eventually would take over the whole world, but they'd start with Eastern Europe. Okay, questions? Comments about any of this? You guys are all with me. Questions. All right, now let me just. I should have actually done this before I kind of skipped over here. Before all that happened in Germany, Mussolini took control of Italy with his Fascist party. Right? And the Fascist party, like I said, was a corporatist party. And it was originally, it was pretty successful. It was able to, for example, they had to say that Mussolini made trains run on time. That he kind of got Italy back into some kind of working order, but he really couldn't improve the economy very much because the worldwide depression was a worldwide depression. And you can't solve a worldwide depression in one country. So what happened was eventually Mussolini starts to lose influence in Italy and he decides that the best way to keep his influence would be to start a war. And so he basically says again, going along with this idea of fascism, the fasci, the Italian symbol of strength, right? That Italy is now going to rebuild the Roman Empire. Empire, right. And the very first place that they start is Ethiopia. But wait a minute. Ethiopia is not part of the Roman Empire? Well, it doesn't matter. Right. But that's where they're going to start. Okay, so they invade Ethiopia. And again, the idea of invading Ethiopia, Ilia invades Ethiopia, and League of Nations does nothing. Right? So that's one of the things that's going to encourage Hitler once he starts to put his plan in motion to take back the Rhine, to invade Czechoslovakia, to invade Austria, knowing that basically there is no stomach in the west for response to German or anybody else's aggression. Right. And so that will then eventually lead to the idea that Hitler has to continue the consolidation of the German nation by invading Poland. Poland, remember, was a new country that had been created after World War I. It had been a country a thousand years earlier, but it hadn't been since then. Right. And so Hitler basically decides to invade Poland. That happens on September 1, 1939, and there will be a. A warning, basically an ultimatum from the British saying, you must stop this war now or we will declare war. And Germany doesn't stop the war. So Britain actually does declare war. And at that point, then we see the Germans, who were able to accomplish the Schlieffen plan that they tried during World War I, knock France out of the war, and basically take over the continent of Europe. Okay, so now we haven't really started in a big way, World War II yet, but we're getting ready to. And then on Thursday, we'll actually start the war. Questions? Comments? Well, if you don't have any questions, I don't have any answers. I'm pumped. You what? He's pumped. I didn't get that pumped. Okay, well, I hope that's good. All right, you guys, you guys, take it easy. I'll see you on Thursday. And we'll have a war. Another war. Boy. Ciao. Thank you, Professor. Take care, buddy. Thank you, Professor. Guys, take care. Hey, so, okay, with my question about the project, essentially. So I wasn't here the Thursday before the break, and I'm guessing that's when you explained the project. Right. Because you didn't explain it beforehand. Oh, you cut out. I can't hear you. Well, no, I didn't. I did explain it on that day. Yeah. Yeah, you did. Okay. I had Internet issues, so I was able to be on there. But anyways, I was kind of concerned because, like. Oh, that's what they all say. Well, no, genuinely, I actually did. I missed my speech. But. But I. I'm. I looked at my. So, like, it's the same groups from the previous project. Right? Or that's what it looks like, at least from the right page. Okay. Well, they haven't made any announcements or discussions or anything like that, which kind of concerns me. Like, last project, they didn't really help me at all. I did like the majority of the work. So I'm just concerned that, like, there's no one working on it right now and I don't have. Which group are you in? Group four. Group four. Like they, what they did? Well, I didn't get any. What? Good. Yeah, go ahead, just tell me about it. Okay, so like what happened in the previous midterm was like. No, essentially like I started the conversation with the first announcement. I made the document, I made all the sources to communicate with each other and I set a deadline for like, when I wanted to see, like, people have at least something done. And that deadline came and went and no one did anything. And it was until literally the very last day at which people started to like, put stuff on the document. And like, it's kind of a tough situation for me because, like, if I knew from the get go that they weren't going to do their portions in a reasonable amount of time, like, I would have like done it for them. Right. But since I didn't, it's just a lack of communication that concerned me. And then at the very end, a lot of them. I totally understand where you're at. Right. Or quality. And I had to edit a lot of them. And it was, it was, I don't know, kind of unfair to me. But regardless, like, I'm just concerned about this. You guys, you guys got a pretty good grade. Right? I understand. But that was because I spent like, you guys working every day. I was, I spent like seven hours that day editing. We're like, I don't know, I'm just concerned that like, I don't even have a document to work. One person got. Yeah. So. Okay, well, the documents online, I'll show you that. I'll tell you what we'll do. I'll tell you what we'll do on. I'm not sure how long our lecture is going to take on Thursday, but what I'm going to do at the. I'm going to make time on Thursday to put everybody back in groups and then I will meet with your group. That'll be nice. Okay. Yeah, I, I will meet with your group and. And then, you know, we'll get that straightened out. Right. I totally understand the frustration of working in groups. Right. But like I said, with this particular, these projects and particularly this format that we're in. It's really the only way. I can't supervise, you know, 100 people. Right. I could supervise four groups, but I can't. Yeah, I get that. So. So anyway, so, yeah, I think that maybe if I sit down with you guys and we work it out, we'll be able to get everybody going in the right direction and then we can maybe set up some guidelines, some deadlines, and then we'll check to see if they're met. If they're not met, then we'll push on that. And if people don't want to participate, that's perfectly fine as long as they realize they're not going to get a grade. Right, Yeah, I understand. You know, that makes sense. Right? For sure. So I'm looking at the one. I just want to. Maybe it'll just be like. I don't want to be, like, working on something that someone's already going to be working on. Like, I don't know what. They've already divided up the work in terms of, like, you know, which topic and stuff, so. So just hold off if they did. Although they did meet. Well, let me just. First off, let me show you. Let me show you here. I'll show you where the documents are. Right? The documents are. I'm looking at the. What for the final bottom. Gotta be here somewhere. I think that's it, right? Yeah. There you go. Panel discussion project right here. Yeah. So. So basically, if you're in group four, you guys are going to be. You guys are going to be looking at. Oh, the Spanish Inquisition. Spanish Inquisition. That's pretty cool, right? Okay, show that. Yeah, you can show that video from Monty Python. Yeah. Nobody expects to smash. But anyway, here's kind of looking at the. Well, first off, let me just say, right, that this is weird how this is working out. But anyway, you can see what I'm looking at right on the screen. Yeah, I can. So the document. Yeah. These are all the things that every group has to do, right? Not everybody in every group has to do all these things, but every group has to do all these things. Right. So, you know, not everybody has to present, but somebody has to present. Right? Okay. That sort of thing. And it's supposed to be up to you guys how that's done. Yeah. But if you, you know, like, if you're having a hard time figuring out how to do that, then I can help you with that. And then down here, this is basically what we're looking at. This is kind of a little explanation. Right. And then in the end, what we're going to do is a 20 minute presentation and also a paper. Right. And this is the format for the paper right here. Right. So, so basically that's it. I really. I really think that students actually enjoy this. Enjoy this project mostly. Right. Although, you know, not everybody. I mean, it happens every time that a number of people just don't participate and they get zeros. Right. But, you know, that's just the way it works with academia, I guess. All right. Does that help? Yeah, that helps. So, yeah, hopefully Thursday we get to. Actually, I just want to know, have an idea of what each person is expected to do. So I know, like, what I should be working on. You know what I mean? Oh, I totally get it. Right. Yeah. So like I said, I've never really had a group that couldn't work together, but. But it could happen. So we'll. We'll make arrangements to make everything work. One of the things about the way that I do the groups is essentially I made the groups at random. Right. And I did that for a purpose. Because in life, we don't get to pick the group that we're. Yeah. We have to figure out how to work with people that we might not even like. Right. So. So. So that's why I do it that way. But we'll. We'll work it out. Well, cool. Thanks for. Yeah, thanks for listening to me. So. Yeah, I feel better now. So thanks for that. Yeah. Thanks for bringing your. Your concerns to me. If you have any more concerns, you know how to get a hold of me. Yep. All right. Have a good day. All right, you too. See you later. Are you there, Bobby?

Ram looking for the new world and the palace in the sun on the shore with his hazy up and down the secrets of the world and his subjects gathered around him like the leaves around the tree and I close up and many colors for the angry gods to see. And the women all were beautiful and the men stood straight and small. He offered life and sacrifice. Sam. Hate was just a legend and war was never known. People work together and they lived their penny stones and they carried them to the flatland but died along the way and they build up with their bare hands they still can't do today and I know she's living there and she loves me to this day I still can't remember where or how I lost my way. You guys like my song? I like that song. Yeah. Great. Do you know why I played that song today? Because we're going to be talking about the New World. We're going to be talking about Cortez. And that was actually Neil Young's version of the conquest of Tenochtitlan, but it wasn't historically accurate, as we'll find out today. Before we get started on the lecture, are there any questions about anything? Comments? No. Let me remind you that on Tuesday, we're going to be discussing those documents that I gave you. And you'll know, if you haven't looked at it yet, you'll notice that one of your tasks is to write a paragraph based on the two documents that I gave you. And you don't want to blow that off because I might ask you to share in class on Tuesday. And don't not come to class because you're afraid of sharing something. Something in class. Right. Just come, and nobody will criticize you. Not even me. All right? Questions? Comments about anything. Okay. So today, let's try to put ourselves in. You guys can see the. The slide, right? It says a new world. Yes. Okay. So up to now, what we've done is we took it like a little tour around the world. We talked about the different power centers, I guess you could say, in 1500. And the last place we looked at was Europe. And one of the things that we learned was that up until about 1500, Europe was a kind of a backwater. And part of the reason for that was because the population was stagnant and the culture was also very stable, meaning that it was almost as if change was resisted. But what happened was because of the rise of the Ottoman Empire, many people from the Eastern Empire moved into what was left of the Western Empire. And they brought with them new knowledge, the Renaissance Okay. The rebirth of knowledge is called the Renaissance. Okay? And that rebirth of knowledge set Europe on a fundamentally. A fundamental change in philosophy and outlook. Okay. Now, that may not have had very much effect on the world because in reality, most of it was, you know, religious. So people were arguing about religion, and we know, for example, that the Muslims had been arguing about religion for centuries, and it didn't have the same kind of enormous effect on the world as what happened with the Christian church broke. But part of the reason why that becomes so important is because of the discovery of America. And the reason for that is because when the Europeans discovered America, they. They were connected to a source of income that they had not had before. And so Europe, which was poor up to this point now, eventually will have a new financial situation where they are not able to. They have more money than they know what to do with. And that money, as we're going to see at first, is going to be invested in fighting wars, religious wars, but eventually that wealth will be invested in technology. And so the Europeans will start to develop technology that the rest of the world doesn't have. Okay? So that's kind of where we're going today. We're just going to focus on that conquest. And again, keep in mind that we're going to do the documents on Tuesday. So talking. What we're talking about today will have some input into what we're going to talk about on Tuesday. All right? Questions, comments about anything. Let's start off with then. We actually already talked a little bit about the different groups of people. I showed you this map on the first lecture day. And there's essentially, I guess we could say really there's essentially four different kinds, or four different. Yeah. Kinds of natives in what we call Mesoamerica and South America. Okay. And. And the, the four different kinds are these. What's labeled here? The Aztec Empire, which isn't exactly correct. Right. But it is. The what, what binds it together is they all speak the language now, wattle. And they all have the same culture. So. So this, if you think about one of the things about the Aztec empire in 1500, it's a lot like Europe in a way, because in Europe they're all broken up into little tiny, little, tiny little dominions or whatever, and they all have their own dialects and they have one common language, and that was. That's Latin. And then they have a common Christian culture. Right. So if we know anything about Europe, then we can know a lot about how the Aztec Empire was organized. Okay. The one thing that we would have to. One difference that we would have to notice about the Aztec empire is that it wasn't an empire in the way that we think about it. Because when we think about an empire, we think about, for example, China. Right. China, at the height of its empire builds a wall. And everything on one side of the wall is China, Everything on the other side of the wall is not china. Right. And the Romans did the same thing. The Romans built a wall and everything on one side of the wall was Rome and everything on the other side wasn't. Okay. The Aztec empire wasn't really an empire of territory. It was more an empire of tribute. And I mentioned to this, due to this, mentioned this to you before, where the nature of the structure of the so called Aztec empire was that the people of Tenoctitlan who were actually at that time called Mexica, would essentially, I'm trying to think of the right word for it. We would demand payment in tribute. And as long as the city that they were demanding payment from paid, they would be left in peace and they could govern their own affairs and they could worship their own gods. And, and that was, there was, there was no kind of cultural or political interference from, from the center Tenochtitlan. If they didn't, then the, the Mexica would conquer them and then they would essentially end up having to pay the, the tribute anyway. Okay. But the main thing was that the Aztecs didn't, or I should say this, the Mexica didn't actually impose their political will on these places. They just wanted the money. And as long as the people paid up, then they were left alone. Okay, the problem with this is then that essentially the Mexica were not rulers. They were more like tax collectors. Right. And how do we like tax collectors? We don't like tax collectors. Right. And that's the reason why many of the different groups in the, what's called here, the Aztec Empire were actually, they, they were, they hated the Mexica, but they were under duress to continue to pay. So they did. Okay, we'll keep that in mind now. For, for now. Okay. One last thing I will say is, and I think I may have mentioned this to you before, that the Aztecs were. There were no Aztecs at this time. The name Aztec comes from a 19th century German explorer named Alexander von Humboldt. And the Aztec, the Mexica legend is that their place of origin was in a place called Aztlan. A Z, T, L, A, N. Okay. And nobody actually really knows for sure where Aztlan was, but that's Their myth told them that they came from Aztlan. And so when Alexander von Humboldt studied these people, he said, well, if they come from Aztlan, they must be Azteca. And that's where the word Aztecs came from. But if you were living in 1519, and when you went into Tenochtitlan and asked, where are all the Aztecs? Everybody would just look at you funny, right? Here's it with me. Questions, Comments about this. And also, one of the things that we have to keep in mind is that those people that we now refer to as the Aztecs were a small group of people called the Mexica that lived in one area here called Tenochtitlan. All right, you guys are all with me on this. Questions, comments? It's not that everybody in that blue area, they were all Aztecs. All right, so they would refer to themselves as Mexica, right? They would have called themselves Mexica. That's why when you read in, for example, both in the. In both of the sources that you've got, they'll talk about the Mexicans. Right? They're. They're actually the Mexica is what it is, but it's translated into Mexicans. They don't call themselves the Aztecs. Right? You get what I'm saying? Okay. All right, Then also there were the Maya. And again, this is a little bit more accurate because this is. It's the Maya cultural area, which means that what holds these groups in common, these. There's 52 different cities here. And what holds these 52 cities in common is the language of the Mayan language, which has many different dialects, but also the common. A common culture. It's similar to the culture of the Nahuatl, but it's a little bit different. Okay, so. So at any rate, the point here is that when we look at this, we can't think about it as a unity because there was no unity among the Mayan peoples. The Mayan peoples were actually at war with each other constantly. All right? And they remained at war with each other and essentially with everybody else up until the 1800s. Okay, questions? Comments about this? All right, then last we talk about the. The Inca and the Inka. As I mentioned to you before, this is more like what we would think of as an empire because the Inca would. Would conquer an area and then they would subdue it by moving the people that were there closer to the center, and then they would move other people into the area that they had conquered. And by doing that, they enforced a cultural similarity, a cultural. A basic cultural Homogenousness, I guess is the word, word for it. Right. But what that meant was that in the end the ruler was actually considered to be something closer to a God than, you know, just somebody that made the rules. Okay. And that's one of the reasons why the Aztec, the Inca empire, sorry to sell so easily, was because when Pizarro captured the emperor Atahualpa and Atahualpa said bring us all the gold, everybody obeyed because they felt that he was a God. And there was really little resistance to the Spanish takeover because of that. Right. So we're really not going to get into that too much today. But the main thing is that we look at these three areas and those three areas have one, they have a similar economy. And in the economy that we're going to call it is called a surplus economy. Okay, we'll talk about this in just a second. Right, Just keep that in mind. Where I'm identifying, these are the places where there is a surplus. Okay. And then the rest of the area here, that's yellow, that doesn't mean nobody lived there. There were a lot of people that were living there. A lot of them were hunter gatherers or lived in small villages or something like that. Right. And what kind of keeps them in common is their economic situation, which was called subsistence. All right, so we have two different economic situations in, among the natives in America before the Spanish come. And those two economies are essentially surplus economy and a subsistence economy. All right, now let me just show you the, I have a slide for this. Okay, so the, the Aztec empire, so called Aztec Empire and all of the different Mayan areas. And, and also the, the Inca had similar economies. Right. Although what I've shown here is the structure of the meshika social structure of the Mexica empire and the way that this works. And it works everywhere in the world at some point or another. It happened in the Americas much later than it happened everywhere else in the world. But what happens is that people start off as hunter gatherers. I don't know if you guys are ever played civilization or anything like that, but you start off as barbarians and then you end up starting to build cities. Right. And that's actually how it works. The reason why people are nomadic is because they have to try to keep up with their food supply and that means they have to keep constantly moving. But what happens is that at some point they develop a stable food supply and that means that they don't have to move anymore. They can stay in one place and when they start to stay in one Place they can build permanent structures, and they start to live in what we call cities. Right? Okay. The Latin word for cities is kivis. C I V I S Kivis. And that's where we get the word civilization. All right? Civilization means that people live in cities. It doesn't have any qualitative implication. It's not like. I mean, the way that we often think about it is there's civilized. Civilized and savages. Right? And the people that live in cities are civilized, and the ones that don't are savages. Right? And we put some qualitative markers on that. So we would say, okay, well, the savage people are. Are primitive, they're stupid, they're not developed, and they're dangerous. And civilized people are just the opposite. They're reasonable and they're smart. But that's not the way it really works. Right? The way it really works, what it really indicates is not any quality of the people, but their economic situation. So if we get into a situation where people are producing food, they will develop a stratified society. Stratified means just like what you see your different levels of society. And this is what happened in central Mexico. It happened also this way in Africa, in China, in Asia, in Europe, everywhere. Right? But it happened much earlier. Right? So when you look at, for example, the rise of Mesopotamia, that's US four, History one, but we're talking about way back when, okay? And it starts with nomads who finally settle down and start to build cities. Right? Same thing here. So the nomads, they settle down, start to build cities. And as they build these cities, they develop a hierarchical social structure. All right? And so when we finally get to 1500 in the valley of Mexico, we have this structure where at the top there's a ruler. At the time of the conquest, it was Montezuma ii. There's other names for him. That's not his real name. That's kind of an Anglophide name, Right? And he was called the Klatawani, which is like God emperor in a way. Okay. The thing about it is that he was a high priest, and he was also an important ruling figure, an important noble. But the one thing about the, the. The. The office of Fathuani was that it was not hereditary. Right? So we think about kings. Kings became king by. By heredity. Right? But that's not what happened in, in the. In the Mexica world. Okay. All right, Then the next tier down from the Tatawani are the Pipiltin, who are the nobles. And they're just like in Europe. They're mostly war leaders and things like that. All right. There are sometimes also scholars in there, priests. Okay. And then underneath that are the merchants. Okay. And then underneath the merchants are the Masifaltin. Right. What we have here really from this point, well, we have the Masiuatin are commoners that actually we would think of them kind of like the guilds in Europe, the craftsmen, artisans, soldiers. Right. And then. And then there's another group of commoners, peasants, who we call. Right. The difference between the Masihualtan and the Mayekis is that the Masi Walton were owners of their own neighborhood. Okay. So. So in the. In the Mexica empire, in Tenochtitlan, the Masihualtin lived in. Or actually, yeah, the Masih. The people lived in neighborhoods, but the people owned the neighborhood in common. Right. And they weren't allowed. They didn't. Nobody owned anything personally, but everybody owned everything in common. Right? And then the Miyekis were also commerce, but they didn't own anything. They didn't. They didn't have common ownership. And so they were more like day workers and things like that. So. So if there was a Home Depot in Tenochtitlan and you drove to the tennis and drove to the Home Depot early in the morning, you would see a bunch of Miyekis standing around waiting for work. Right? You get what I'm saying? That's essentially what the Miyeekes are. And then we have two different groups of slaves. Slaves are mostly captured in war. And the two different kinds of slaves are slaves that work. Work in the fields and things like that. And the slaves were sacrificed. Okay? So the. The slaves who were sacrificed are very important in Mexica, in Nahuatl culture, because the Nahua believed, and also the Mayans believe, that the gods demanded the sacrifice of humans hearts essentially in order to keep the sun in the sky. Okay? So they will only be satisfied and keep the sun in the sky as long as. As there was a constant sacrifice of human hearts. And one of the things that happened in Tenochtitlan was it became. It was massive human sacrifice practiced at a scale that. I mean, I would say this human sacrifice comes from every culture, right? But it was practiced on a massive scale in. In Tenochtitlan and in the Nahua world. Okay, questions? Comments about any of this? For example, one of the things that happened during the lifetime of Montezuma was that they. They completed a new test temple called the Temple of Mayor. And when they dedicated that temple, they. They sacrificed 16, 000 people, okay? What? And the way that they would do it would. They would take a sharp piece of obsidian and bust open the chest of the person who was being sacrificed, rip their heart out while it was still beating, and then throw their body off the. Into a pit, essentially. Right, so. And they. So it took them weeks to do that. Okay, I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh, but that's the way they did it. Okay. I think I laughed because it's so gruesome. All right, Anyway, Questions? Comments about any of that? Okay, so now, in contrast, the subsistence economy basically is everybody working together to produce enough for everybody to live, right? And they may have a cacique, some kind of a ruler, tribal chieftain. Sometimes they're ruled by maybe a group of people, something like that. Right? But mainly it's much more democratic than this, this sort of society, because everybody is needed to do everything to make sure that everybody gets taken care of. Okay, you follow me here? All right, so now what separates the subsistence economy from the surplus economy is that in the surplus economy, these four groups on the bottom are able to create enough for everybody to live on. And what that does is it frees up the people at the top to do other things like write and fight wars and trade and things like that, right? So what happens is that all of the wealth of the society is produced by these bottom. Actually, these three groups, okay? And the. Those three groups produce enough to support themselves, and then everything that's left over goes to the top, right? So what's left over is called the surplus. You guys get that? So, so really what we have here in the city of Tenochtitlan is a money making machine, right? Because this machine is making money and the money is pouring into the top. All right, you guys got that in. Oh, sorry, I screwed up. Okay? Now in this other society, right, everybody makes enough for everybody to live on, and there isn't anything left over. Okay? So. So there isn't any surplus. That doesn't mean that they're poor necessarily. They all have enough, but they don't. There isn't any surplus that can go to somebody who, who uses it without actually producing it. Okay, you guys got what I'm saying? Questions? Comments? All right. Okay, so now let's think about it. If we're Spanish and we think about why did the Spanish come to America? Anybody want to guess on that one? Why did the Spanish come to America? I'm going to tell you in a few minutes, but I want to see what you guys have to say. Was it for gold? Well, Kind of. It was for wealth. Now, we've talked a little bit about Columbus already. Why did Columbus decide to sail west? What was he looking for? Another route to China. Another route to China. And did they know that America was there? He did not know that America was there. Right. That's the biggest kind of coincidence, I guess you could say, in history. Okay, so. So when he found America, he didn't find China. He always thought that he did. But other Spanish came and they realized it's not China. Right. And so what did they do? What was their purpose in being there? Weren't they trying to convert them? Well, that was secondary. That's true. Right. That was. But that was secondary resources. Exactly. They want to get rich. I mean, the people, the Spanish who came to America came to get rich. Okay, so now if you are a Spaniard and you come to a social situation like this one where there isn't any surplus, where are you going to find value? Is it going to be in the land or in the people? The people. If there's nothing left over, they're not producing more. They're not producing anything in surplus. Who, what, where would the value be? The land or the people? It would direct their attention towards the land, I guess. The land, exactly. So what happens, you see, in the Caribbean, the. And also in, you know, in Mexico later. Right, that they. The Spanish established sugar plantations, Right. So they can exploit the land. Right. And so now, once they've taken control of the land, what happens to the people? They're subjugated. They could be subjugated. They could be killed. The Spanish tried to. To enslave them, but. But natives don't make very good slaves for a number of different reasons. And so eventually, what ended up happening? If we look at the. For example, the islands in the Caribbean, do you know why we call the Caribbean the Caribbean? Because the native peoples in that region were called the Karim. Where do you think the Karib are today? They don't exist. They don't exist anymore. They only exist in the name that's there. Why? Because the Spanish mostly didn't deliberately kill them off, but they. Most of them died from diseases. Right, but at any rate, the main point I'm trying to make is that if you're Spanish and you want to establish, if you want to gain wealth, you want to gain value from this new land that you found, and it's this kind of an economy, then the money is going to come from the land and you have to move the people. Okay? But if we're in. If we find this kind of society, where is the value? Is it in the land or is it in the people? It's in the people. It's in the people, exactly. So the Spanish strategy in this always was to cut off the top, right? They would cut off the top. I'm sure you read in your book that the first thing that Montezuma does, excuse me, the first thing that Cortez does is imprison Montezuma and puts him. Actually in theory, he says in King Charles is in control, but in reality it's him and the Conquistadores. Right? And what that means is that this is a money making machine down here and it's pumping money up to the top. Right? So now if the money, if the value is in the people, what is going to be your relationship to this social structure? Do you want to kill off all the people or do you want to keep them healthy and alive? You will want to build a healthy relationship with the community. Exactly. You want. I mean, basically this group of people here were used to being ruled and to them it didn't matter whether they were ruled by Spanish or by the Mexican nobility. Right. In fact, the Spanish left the Mexica nobility in control in most places. Right, okay. As long as they paid up to, to the, to the king or to the conquistadores. Right. So the only, the only requirement that was put on this group of people in terms of change was that they had to stop worshiping the, the Mexica gods, the Nahua gods, and start to worship Jesus Christ. Right. And we think, well, that's terrible. It's cultural appropriation, all that stuff. But really that was common in conquest. Whoever conquered a group of people would almost always enforce their religion on them. Right? So the only thing that really changed for these people was that rather than sacrificing to which the Pochtli, they were, you know, attending Christian churches. Okay. And paying the church. All right, you guys get what I'm saying? Questions, comments about this? All right, so, so now what that means then is that the Spanish intention in terms of these societies wasn't to destroy them, but to do what, to maintain them. Right. Because that was their source of wealth. Okay, but what happens is that within a very few years of the Spanish conquest, this social structure collapses because the people die. Why did the people die? European diseases. Exactly. Old World diseases. Right. And so they weren't able to maintain this structure. And the, the Aztec empire or the, the Mexican social structure collapses and eventually sort of looks like this. Okay, except it's not centered here. It's not. It's not nomadic. All right, Questions, Comments about this? All right, so now the reason why I'm. Well, let's just leave that for now and hopefully I'll be able to come back to that later if I don't forget. Okay. Okay. Any questions or comments about that? The economics. Let me just mention the reason why it's important to look at things in terms of economics is because if I were to ask you what happened when the Spanish came to America, many of you would say, oh, they came and they deliberately killed all the people and stole their stuff, right? That's what you say. Because that's what we. That's the way our culture thinks about this event. Okay? And. And we. There is a, A kind of a narrative that's called the Black Legend. You may. You probably haven't heard of the Black legend, right? But the Black Legend is that just what I said. The Spanish came to America and they, they killed all the people deliberately with, you know, infested blankets and stuff like that. And then they took all their stuff and they stole their culture, right? And that's the way we kind of remember this. And we say, well, Spanish were a bunch of brutes, essentially. Right? Well, who starts this Black legend? Who starts the Black legend are the French and the English. The French and the English say, look what they did in Spanish America. They're awful, right? But the only thing is that the French and the English did exactly the same thing as the Spanish. The only difference was that the French and the English didn't find any civilized groups in America. All the groups that they found in America were subsistence level, right? And that means then that the natives essentially were pushed aside so that the Europeans could extract value from the land. You guys get what I'm saying? So economic, what really drives the, the policy of a colonial power isn't going to be the kind of cultural characteristics of the colonial power. It's going to be their strategy for, for extracting value. Okay, guys, with me. Questions, comments about that. And that's why the economics part of it is so, so important. All right, any questions or comments, guys, are good. Let's do. Let's talk about 1492. You guys all know what happened in 1492, right? What? That's the Continental. Columbus sailed the ocean blue. Columbus sailed the Ocean Blue. Exactly. 1492. Columbus sailed the ocean blue. Okay, but that's really not the only thing that happened during that, okay? In reality, there were three very important things that happened in Spain in 1492. Okay, so, so the one thing is we want to look at this date and on. On last Thursday, we actually. Tuesday we talked about the Renaissance. And this is at the. Almost near the end of the Renaissance, okay. In Europe. Okay. Keep in mind what's going on in the rest of Europe. And then it's going to be 1517 is going to be the beginning of the wars of the Reformation. All right? So it's not too long after this date, and it's really at the beginning of Spanish colonization in America. So just kind of keep that in mind. All right, so the three things that are important then that happened in, in 1492 in Spain. The first one is the completion of what's called Lare Conquista. Right. La Reconquista basically was the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula from the Moors. All right? And we've already seen this to a certain extent that at. In year 7 11, the Muslim crossed this strait, and that's why it's called Gibraltar. Right. And. And he conquered all of the Iberian Peninsula except for this area right here. Right. And he. He actually invaded France, but was pushed back by a man named Charles Martel, who was the father of Charlemagne. Okay. You don't need to know any of that, but that's what happened. Okay? So from that year on 7 11, that's the year you can remember that. That's where you get beer and cigarettes. Right? So from 711 until 1492, there was a religious warfare between the Christians and the Moors. And over the centuries, almost seven centuries, right, The Christians continue to push back the Moors. You can see the different dates here, right. Until the only place left in Spain that was occupied or controlled by the Moors was granada. And in 1492, the. The Catholic kings, which is Ferdinand and Isabella. I know that Isabella shouldn't be called the king, but that's what they call them, kings. Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada and the Moors were expelled from the Iberian Peninsula. Okay? And so this is basically what, what Spain looked like. And keep in mind that this was not Spain, okay? This was the Iberian Peninsula. And there were different kingdoms here. There was the Kingdom of Portugal, the Kingdom of Castile, the Kingdom of Aragon, the Kingdom of Navarre. Right? And these different kingdoms eventually ended up being ruled by the Catholic kings, all of them, except for Portugal. Right. Okay. So, so when the Spanish came to America, they didn't call themselves Spanish. Does anybody want to guess what they call themselves? Conquistadores. No. That's what they were, but that's not what they call themselves. How would they introduce themselves. Well, they didn't say Iberians. What? They said Castile. Some of them did say that, but they didn't all come from Castile. Right. So what they really refer to themselves as. As, well, who was fighting against who here in Conquistad? The Franks. No, Christians and the Moors. The Christians and the Moors, Right. So when the Spanish came to America, they called themselves Christians. Christians, exactly. So what that tells us then is that there wasn't any sense of nationality at this time. People identified themselves by their religion. Okay, you guys got me here. Okay, keep that in mind. So that's different from the way we think about it today. We would never have. If somebody came up to you and say, where are you from? You wouldn't say, I'm a Christian. Right. Or I'm not a Christian or whatever. Right. You would say, you know, you came from California or something like that. Right. Okay, so. So now that was the first thing. The second thing was the expulsion of the Jews because they figured that since they got rid of the Moors, they might as well get rid of the Jews too. And what that means then is that the, the Spanish kingdom actually becomes a hard line Catholic kingdom. Right. And we want to keep that in mind. There's a couple reasons for that. One is because the ruler of Spain is king, becomes King Charles V. Sorry, King Charles the First. Who is King Charles V, who is from Austria and he's the Holy Roman Emperor. Okay. Now let's see if we can remember back to Tuesday. What is the job of the Holy Roman Emperor? Of what? Okay, they administered. Was it like salvation or whatever? No, not the kings. Right. Think about this. We talked about the Empire of Christendom. Who rules the Empire of Christendom? Christ. Okay. But now Christ doesn't rule on earth. So who rules on earth for Christ? The Papacy. The Pope. Right, but the Pope doesn't, theoretically doesn't have the military power, the violence, in order to be able to rule. So who does that? They enforce. Yeah, so you're right, exactly. So it's the Holy Roman Emperor then, is the protector of Christendom. Right. You get what I'm saying? So they're hardline Christians. And think about now that not too long after this we're going to see the different places in Northern Europe start to break away from the Catholic Church. What would be the job of the Holy Roman Emperor when he saw that? Bring him back. Bring them back online, Try to bring them back. Exactly. And what we see here then is that with the discovery of America, the Holy Roman Emperor has access to a new resource that he's going to use to, to fund wars against Protestants, right? This is going to be part of the religious wars that we talked about. Okay? So, so now once that, once Spain has become, has, has expelled the Moors and expelled the Jews, now they want to engage in trade. And we've talked a little bit about trade already. We said that trade with Asia, that's where you want to trade from because that's where all the goodies are, right? So you want to trade with Asia, but the routes to trade with Asia, either the overland routes, the Silk Road or the over water routes are blocked because the overland routes are controlled by the Italians, Italian city states, actually Venice and Genoa. Right. And the over water routes are controlled by the Portuguese, Right. And, and so the Spanish really don't have an access to, to this, to this trade. Okay. And that's why even though this guy, Cristobal Colon, he comes to, he's been going around Europe for a long time saying that you can sail west and get to China and everybody in Europe knows that you can't, right? Not because they believe America is there, but because they know that it's so far away you could never make it there on a ship, right? So, so nobody wants to listen to him, but he goes to Ferdinand and Isabella and they say, well, you know, it's not going to hurt us anything. We'll give him three ships and we'll let him sail west, right? So he sails west. His first voyage is going to be kind of this route. It's a little confused here, but, but eventually he runs into, actually it's interesting. October 12, 1492. He cites land and he believes that he's found China because that's where his calculations said China should be, right. And, and he landed here. And when they sighted the land and the people on the land were, saw them, the Spanish arriving in their ships, they jumped up and down, said hooray, we've been discovered. Right? No, that's not what happened. Right, but at any rate the point here is that, is that they found people here. And Columbus reports back to Spain that he's found another way to China. And, or the Indies is basically what he calls it, which is why everybody in, everybody from, from the North Pole to basically the South Pole in the Americas is called Indians. Right? So so basically then calling everybody in the Americas Indians is a lot like saying everybody from Belfast to Beijing is Mexican. Right? Did you get it? So, so the name Indians is not really appropriate because that's a name that's that's imposed by a mistake from the, from, sorry, from. From the Spanish. From the Europeans. Okay. Questions, Comments about this? All right, so now once they discover, eventually they're going to discover, the Spanish will discover that this is not the East Indies, then they call it the West Indies. Right? But what they're discover is that they haven't found China. What they have found a man named Amerigo Vespucci. Amerigo Vespucci will realize that what they have found is a new. Is Novo Mundo. What is Novo Mundo? New land, New continent. New New world. Exactly. New world. Okay. And so that's why everything here is called America is named after America. Right. Okay. So you guys who are Italian extraction can be happy about that, I guess. But at any rate, the point here is that the one thing that was a problem for them was that they didn't find the, the trading opportunities that they were looking for in China and instead they found a bunch of steamy islands, right. That. That didn't really have very much wealth. And so what they ended up doing was, was establishing sugar plantations. Right. We'll just leave it at that for now. Questions, Comments about this? So now let me show you. This is eventually what will be ruled by the Spanish Empire. Everything here, except for Brazil, Brazil was, was, was ruled by the Portuguese. And I'm just going to leave it at that for now. Okay, Any questions or comments about this? Okay, so now we've discovered America and we're going to go a little bit, we're going to go into the, into the. Let me look at. Let's go back to this for a minute and look at this. Right? The Spanish established their island, their kind of headquarters here in Hispaniola in what we would call the Caribbean, right? And they continued to explore. And at first they, they didn't know that a lot of this other land was here, okay? But the more they explored, the more they were able to figure out what's here. Okay. At one point, they found this. The Yucatan Peninsula, right? And Yucatan Peninsula, they thought it was an island. They didn't know that it was part of a continent. Okay? But at any rate, they landed on the Yucatan Peninsula. And when they did, there were the Spanish who came to the shore in boats and there were the hostile natives. The natives in Maya, in the Mayan area were hostile. And the Spanish yelled out in Spanish to the natives, what is the name of this place? And the natives hollered back, yucatan, which means go away. But that's where, that's how Yucatan got its name. Its name go away, Right. Eventually what happens is that they continue to explore. And one of the reasons why they do is because they're looking, they. They hear a. They hear a legend that there's a place somewhere in the west that's called El Dorado. El Dorado is actually not the place. El Dorado is the ruler of the place. The reason why they call him that is El Dorado means the golden one, right? And they say that he and his empire are so rich that he. That he's. That he's covered in gold, right? And they want the gold, right? So. So they. At first they thought that El Dorado was on the east coast of Africa. They never found it there. But now they think, oh, it must be here in America somewhere. And they conquered these islands. And when they conquered these islands, they kept asking the natives, where's the gold? Right? And the natives kept telling, it's in the west. You got to go to the west. Okay? And so they continue to explore, and eventually they find, you know, the coast of what we call today, we call Mexico. All right. Questions? Comments about this? Okay. So now, when. When Cuba was the way the Spanish army worked, the way the Spanish conquest worked was that the king would grant permission to a captain to build an army and conquer some area of land, right? And then once the area of land had been conquered, he would give the land to the king, and in return, the king would grant him rewards, right? And then the rewards would go to him and everybody else that was in his army. You know, depending on where you were at in hierarchy would be how much of a reward you would get, right? And most of these people ended up with rewards of land. They weren't. They weren't owners of land. They were kind of proprietors in a way of land. And these. These gifts were called encomienda, Right? Encomienda. So we'll talk about that in a second here. It's also called repatimiento, but we're just going to say encomienda. And the problem with the encomiendas was that wasn't what anybody wanted. The last thing anybody from Spain wanted to do was to come to America and live on a steamy plantation in the middle of nowhere, right? So the Spanish culture is a. Is an urban culture. They wanted. What they want to do was come to America, get rich, and go back to Spain and live like hidalgos. Hidalgo. Hidalgo comes from. Which means son of something, Right? They wanted to be sons of something, and they couldn't do that here, right? So. So There was a disappointment, really, for many of them, okay? But they kept. That's one of the reasons why they kept looking for this goal, for this El Dorado, right? And. And so the guy who was given the. The charter to conquer Cuba was named Diego Velasquez. And in return for. Given. In return for his conquest, he was given control over these islands by the king, and he decided to mount another expedition to the west to see if he could find this gold, right? And the person he chose to lead his expedition was a man named Hernan Cortez. Right? Sometimes he's called Hernando, but he's not really Hernandez Cortez, right? And so Cortez starts to. He gets some ships, and he starts to build an army to go and to do his exploration. And Velasquez gets. Well, there were other people on the island that wanted to have that expedition. So they went to Velazquez and said, you know, Cortez is getting ready to betray you. And so Velasquez decides to take the commission away from Cortez. But Cortez finds out about it before he's given the information, and he takes off, right? So now Cortez sails along this coast, right? And keep in mind that when he and all the people that are with him are sailing along this coast, they're all criminals. They're all acting against the will of the ruler, Diego Velasquez. You guys with me? Okay? But nevertheless, they keep. They. Their idea is if they find El Dorado, all will be forgiven. Okay? So they keep going. And one of the places where they stop here, they receive a gift of slave women from the natives. And the name of one of the slave women was Malinsin. Malinsin. And so Cortez takes a liking to Malinsin, and Malinsin and Cortez become an item. They actually have a child together, right? Malinson becomes known in Spanish as Dona Marina. She comes from the sea, right? But according to other people at the time, she's known as La Malinche. And the reason why she's known as La Malinche is because Malinche is Cortez, right? So La Malinche means the one who belongs to Cortez, Right? You got. You guys got that? Okay, so now, the significance of finding La Malinche was that she had actually been born in this area and had been sold into slavery by her mother, right? And so she ended up over here in this area, and she learned she knew both Nahua and both Nawa and Maya, right? And she was very quick to pick up on Spanish. So she became Cortez, interpreter. Iftan la lingua. Right. Okay, you guys are all following here and now. Yes. Cortez continues along this coast and eventually lands at a place that today is called Veracruz. And it's called Veracruz because they land on the day of the Veracruz. Right. So now, we talked about all this already. So what happens is that he learns from the local natives and also from La Maliche that the. There's a great, powerful empire somewhere to the west. And so he starts to march toward what eventually will be. He'll find his Tenochtita. Right. And. And along the way, he is pretty much able to avoid conflict until he gets to a place called Tlachcala. Now, Tlaxcala is the rival of Tenochtitlan. Tenochtitlan has been trying to conquer Tlaxcala for a long time, but the Tlaxcalans actually were opposed to Cortez at the beginning, and they fought a battle. But eventually what happened was that Cortez made an alliance with Tlaxcala. All right, so now we have the Spanish and their native allies, Tlaxcalans. Right? And the Tlaxcalans kind of pull a little trick on Cortez and say that and essentially convince him to invade and kill all the people in Cholula. Right. Cholula. Just. It was. It was a city that had once been allied with Tlaxcala, but they had changed their allegiance to Tenochtitlan. And so then the Tlaxcalans were very much angry, I guess you could say, with them. And they used the Spanish as a tool, essentially, to wipe them out and bring them back into their empire. And then Cortez continues to march until he reaches the Valley of Mexico, or the Valley of Anahuat is. And one of the things you'll notice here is that the Valley of Anahuac is a bunch of lakes. Did you guys notice that? Okay. And if we actually look at that area here, Right. You'll see that there's all these different lakes. And in the city of Tenochtitlan is in the middle right of the lake that was actually built there. Okay. There was no island in the middle of the lake. Okay. The. The Mexica built their. Their. Their home there. And the reason why they did was because nobody on the outside would allow them to settle anywhere near them because they were brutal. They were beasts. Right. They were gruesome. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions. I mean, at one point, they invited one of the feeders of one of these other cities to dinner. And what they had done was they had taken this guy's daughter and turned her into a coat, and they gave him the coat as his gift. That shows kind of the way they thought about things. Right? Okay, so the question then is, well, has anybody here ever been to Mexico City? Okay, Leopoldo, where's lake? Is Mexico City in the middle of a lake? Yes. No, there's no lake there. The lakes are all gone. Where did the lakes go? Well, it was filled in. It was filled in. Exactly. By who? All right, I'll tell you. I don't want to make you guys uncomfortable, right? But what happened was that the Mexicans, actually, the natives here, and later the Mexican government, the Spanish government, and the Mexican government wanted to drain these lakes because they were a health hazard, among other things. But they were never able to do it until Mexico City was actually occupied by American troops in 1847 and 1848. And as a favor to the Mexicans, the American army drained the lakes, Right? So. So there are no lakes there now. But it's interesting that if you go to the center of the city of Tenochtitlan, which is where the Sokolo is, and the Temple of Mayor and the National Cathedral and the government office and all those things, right? They have pools that show where the water level was. Okay, you guys are with me. All right, so anyway, and the other thing about that is that that means that tenors should say, now, Mexico City is built on a lake bed, right? Which is like building a city on Jello, which is why whenever there's an earthquake there, it's so devastating, because the ground is not. It's not solid. Okay, questions? Comments about this? All right, so. So now the Montezuma finds out that. That Cortez is on the way, and he sends somebody to go and try to stop him, right? And so if you look in at this. This painting. Not painting, but that's the wrong thing. If you look at this drawing here, this drawing is the meeting of Montezuma's emissary and Cortes, right? And guess who that is. Okay, so what they. What they did was they gave him a bunch of gifts, and he said, go away. Don't come back. Don't come any closer. But Cortez was not about to turn back. Okay? And so what ends up happening then is he enters the city. He and his Flash Colin allies enter the city here, and it's on this causeway that Montezuma meets Cortez. Okay? And that's what your readings are going to be about. If you haven't started yet, you. This is what the readings are talking about is this meeting of Cortez and Montezuma, right? One of the things that you'll notice is that when in the native source, it records Montezuma as saying, we've been waiting for you. And Diaz, the Spanish chronicler doesn't mention that. Okay? I want you to keep that in mind When. When. For when we talk, when you're reading it and when we talk about the documents. Okay? Just keep that in mind. All right, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? All right, so what happens then is that Cortez and his army are invited into Tenochtitlan. The flash islands have to stay out, right? Here's a picture of. No, I'm sorry. It's not it either. I hope you guys aren't getting dizzy. Right. Okay, so here is what kind of an imagine. Imagine imaginary what Tenochtitlan might have looked like at the time of Cortez arrival. And this is the. The causeway where Cortez met Montezuma. And this is the Temple of Mayor, which is today where the Sokalo is. You know what the Sokolo is? Anybody? Let me just tell you. Sokolo is the national square. It's a central square of Mexico City. Every Spanish city has a central square, and in the middle of it has a great big, gigantic Mexican flag. And it's really the center of Mexico. All right? Questions? Comments? About any of this? All right? Okay. So now it doesn't go well. All right? We say, okay, everything's conky dory because Montezuma invites Cortez and his men into Tenoctilan. But the first. One of the first things that Montezuma that Cortez does is he captures Montezuma, right? Because he's afraid that they're surrounded by millions of Indians or natives, Mexica. And they're afraid that Montezuma might turn on him. So they captured Montezuma and imprisoned him, right? And then there's the tension between the Spanish and the natives grow, okay? Now, in the meantime, remember we said that when. When Cortez left from Cuba, he became a criminal because he didn't have the. The permission of Diego Velasquez anymore, okay? And so what happens is that Diego Velasquez eventually sends a invasion of group, an army, I guess you could say, against Cortez, called Panfilo, led by a guy named Panfilo Danvar. And he lands at Veracruz at about the same time as Cortez is In Mexico City. Right. You guys are with me. So Cortez learns that he has. That he's being challenged, and he leads some of his troops back to Veracruz, where they fight a battle against Narvaez. And they win. Okay. Now and then he goes back to Mexico City or Tenochtitlan. But in the meantime, the guy who was left in charge in Mexico City, Pedro de Alvarado, was kind of a bonehead, right? And he eventually orchestrates a massacre of natives at one of their holy rituals in this near the temple. Right? And so that is essentially the straw that broke the camel's back. And the people in Tenochtitlan are now very much against the Spanish. We want to wipe them out, essentially. Right. So the Spanish are forced to escape from Mexico City in a night that's called la noche triste, which means the sad night. And they're ousted from. So by the time Cortez comes back, is no longer. He's no longer welcome there. Okay, you guys are with me. Questions? Comments? Now, in the meantime, Montezuma was killed even before all of this happened. Nobody really knows who killed him. Some people say Spanish, some people say the natives killed him. But anyway, he was dead. Okay. And so there's a new emperor now called Watemok, and he fights a war against the Spanish and the natives who are allied with the Spanish. Okay. And the war lasts for several months. Actually, eventually, what ends up happening is that is that the Spanish build ships to sail on these lakes, and they bombard Tenochtitlan and they land troops. And eventually there's a place just north of the Sokolo, not too far. You can actually walk from the Socalor to a place called Tlateloco. And that's where Guatemala essentially had his last stand. And the Aztec empire falls. Okay. The one thing that we want to keep in mind about all this is that the story that's told from the western point of view is that Cortez and 600 intrepid soldiers and sailors conquered the Aztec empire. Well, yeah, except that it was them plus tens of thousands of Indian allies. Okay, now, the question we want to ask ourselves is why were the Indian allies on the same side as Cortez? Why weren't they on the side of the Aztec? Because the Aztecs were such a brutal overlords and they didn't like them. That's true. But didn't they believe he was a kwaza Wattso, the great God? Maybe. We'll talk about that on Tuesday. Right, but the main thing here is that. That they didn't think of the world in terms of natives and Spanish or Europeans and natives. They thought of it in terms of different groups of people. The Spanish were one group and the Mexica were another group. Right. But there wasn't. There wasn't any affinity between the Mexica and say, the Tlash goblins because they didn't see themselves as having anything in common. They were actually rival groups. Right. You guys get what I'm saying? Okay, so. All right. So anyway, we're done with the conquest. And I think I should end now because there's one other thing I need to talk about, and that is the encomienda system. But I'm not going to be able to do it today. I think it would be kind of too close. Right. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to let you guys go and then we'll talk about the Encomienda system first at the beginning of class on Tuesday. Okay? Any questions, comments that I can help you with? Yeah, the. I saw in the modules the. The questions, but I wasn't seeing the documents for our readings. What? You're absolutely right. I completely forgot about that. I noticed it the other day and I was going to do something about it. I'm going to stop sharing now, right? I was going to do something about it and then I forgot because, you know, I'm old and senile. No worries. And happily so. Actually, I know the happier I am. Right, but. So let me go ahead and fix that right now. Hold on a second. It. Well, I'm gonna. I'll do it right now. You guys can go if you want. Unless you got a question. I'll hang out here, but I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna put it on right now. So within 10 minutes it'll be up. Okay, you guys can go. You don't have to hang around. Watch me do this. Thanks, Professor. All right, have a good one. You too. Do anything I wouldn't do. Thank you. Vanessa, did you need something for me? Yes, sorry. I was just waiting for you to upload the thing. Yeah, remember we met on Tuesday because of the quiz that it didn't let me take. Still didn't let me take it. You just added more time. It was still closed. It just doesn't like you, that's all. I know. I'm just like. I was right here having a mini panic attack. Let's go. It was chapter one or chapter two? The first one, right? Yeah, the first one. Did you take the second one? No, I'm gonna take it right now after this. I was wondering if you had the same problem on that one. No. Oh, let's hope. All right. I think you should be able to do it now. All right. Do you mind if I check real quick? Yeah, go ahead. Okay. Yeah, I think it's letting me. Okay, but you got only 30 minutes now, so. Okay. Well, thank you so much. All right, we'll see you later. We'll see you on Tuesday. Have a good one.

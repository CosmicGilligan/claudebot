## üéØ The Bone-Chilling Question That Defines Our Modern World

**How does the world's greatest economic collapse turn millions of ordinary people into supporters of history's most monstrous regimes - and what does this tell us about the fragility of democracy itself?**

Picture this: breadlines stretching for blocks in bustling cities, abandoned farms choked with dust, and the air thick with uncertainty and fear. This wasn't just an economic crisis - it was a **crisis of faith in the entire liberal democratic system**. When capitalism spectacularly failed, desperate people reached for desperate solutions. Some of those solutions wore uniforms, demanded absolute loyalty, and promised simple answers to complex problems.

This is the story of how the "War to End All Wars" created economic conditions that spawned ideologies so extreme they made the Great War look like a warm-up act.

## üí∏ The Great Debt Balloon: How Victory Became Defeat

### The Toxic Legacy of Versailles

Let's start with a hard truth that challenges everything you think you know about war and economics: **World War I was an economic disaster for everyone, including the winners** üìä.

Britain, France, and Germany ran out of money about a year into the conflict. By 1917, these industrial powerhouses were drowning in debt, and the war's end didn't stop the bleeding - it made it worse.

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e3c72 0%, #2a5298 50%, #1e3c72 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 5px solid #ffd700;">
<h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">üéà The Great Debt Balloon Cycle</h4>
<ul style="color: #e8e8e8;">
<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> American banks lend money to Germany</li>
<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Germany uses that money to pay reparations to Britain and France</li>
<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Britain and France use reparations to pay war debts to American banks</li>
<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> American banks lend more money to Germany to keep the cycle going</li>
<li><strong>The Problem:</strong> This isn't wealth creation - it's just moving debt around in circles!</li>
</ul>
</div>

This wasn't sustainable economics - it was a **financial shell game**. Real wealth creation comes from productive investment, building factories, improving technology, expanding trade. This cycle was just shuffling paper around, creating the illusion of prosperity while building toward catastrophe.

**The hot air keeping this debt balloon inflated?** The roaring American stock market of the 1920s.

### Trading on Margin: The Casino Economy

Here's where it gets really scary. By the late 1920s, America had essentially turned its stock market into a **giant casino** üé∞ - and everyone from barbers to bankers was gambling with borrowed money.

**Trading on margin** meant you could buy $100 worth of stock with just $10 down, borrowing the other $90 from your broker. Sounds great, right? But you weren't gaining $90 in equity - you immediately owed $90 in debt, secured by the very stock you just bought.

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #8b0000 0%, #dc143c 50%, #8b0000 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 5px solid #ffd700;">
<h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">üé≤ The Mathematics of Catastrophe</h4>
<ul style="color: #e8e8e8;">
<li><strong>90% of all trading</strong> was done on margin by the late 1920s</li>
<li><strong>40% of all money loaned</strong> in the US was for stock speculation</li>
<li><strong>Banks were gambling</strong> with depositors' money</li>
<li><strong>The government response:</strong> Nothing. Laissez-faire was an article of faith</li>
<li><strong>National mentality:</strong> "The market can never go down"</li>
</ul>
</div>

**Think about the scale of this insanity:** Nearly every stock transaction involved borrowed money. Banks weren't acting as conservative stewards of savings - they were actively speculating with other people's life savings. The entire American economy had become a massive bet that stock prices would rise forever.

**What could possibly go wrong?** üò¨

## üí• October 1929: When the Music Stopped

### The Crash That Broke the World

When the market correction finally hit in October 1929, it revealed the horrifying truth: **most of the wealth never existed in the first place** üíÄ.

Stock prices had become completely disconnected from actual company values. When prices crashed back to reality, billions of dollars in "wealth" simply vanished because it had never been real - just speculation and borrowed money.

For people trading on margin, the consequences were devastating. If your $100 stock (bought with $10 down and $90 borrowed) dropped to $50, you still owed your broker $90. You now owed more money than your investment was worth. **Margin calls** forced people to sell at any price, creating a vicious downward spiral.

### The Banking Collapse: Capitalism Without Capital

Here's the terrifying part: when the stock market collapsed, **so did the banking system** üè¶üíÄ.

Banks had been using depositors' money to speculate in stocks. When those investments vanished, banks couldn't return people's savings. As news spread of bank failures, terrified customers rushed to withdraw their money - but banks operate on fractional reserves. They don't actually hold all deposits in cash.

**The result:** Bank runs, bank closures, and millions of people losing their life savings overnight. No deposit insurance. No government bailouts. Just gone.

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #2c1810 0%, #8b4513 50%, #654321 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 5px solid #ff6347;">
<h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">‚öôÔ∏è The Capitalism Death Spiral</h4>
<ul style="color: #e8e8e8;">
<li><strong>No Banks = No Capital:</strong> Without functioning banks, there's no money for loans</li>
<li><strong>No Loans = No Production:</strong> Companies can't pay workers or buy materials</li>
<li><strong>No Production = No Jobs:</strong> Mass unemployment reaches 25% in the US</li>
<li><strong>No Jobs = No Consumers:</strong> Nobody has money to buy products</li>
<li><strong>The Vicious Cycle:</strong> Each step makes the next step worse</li>
</ul>
</div>

**The bitter irony:** You can't have capitalism without capital. When the capital disappeared, the entire system ground to a halt.

### Global Contagion: Dependency Theory in Action

This wasn't just an American problem - it was a **global catastrophe** that proved how interconnected the world economy had become üåç.

**Dependency Theory in Practice:** When the industrialized "metropolis" economies (US, Britain, France, Germany) collapsed, they stopped buying raw materials from the "periphery" economies. If English textile factories shut down, they stopped buying cotton from India. If American factories closed, they stopped importing copper from Chile.

**The result:** Economic devastation rippled across the globe. Colonial and semi-colonial economies that depended on exporting raw materials to industrial nations found their markets gone, their prices collapsed, their people starving.

By 1932-1933, the industrial economy of the entire world had largely seized up.

## ‚ò≠ The Soviet Exception: "Communism Works!"

### The Lie That Convinced Millions

There was one major exception to this global collapse: **the Soviet Union** üá∑üá∫. While capitalist nations were drowning in unemployment and poverty, the USSR appeared stable, even prosperous.

Soviet propaganda seized on this, loudly proclaiming: **"See? Communism works! Capitalism has failed!"**

To millions of desperate, unemployed people watching their children go hungry while their savings vanished, this was a powerful message. Intellectuals, artists, workers across the globe began seriously considering socialism and communism as viable alternatives to a broken capitalist system.

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #cc0000 0%, #ff0000 50%, #cc0000 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 5px solid #ffd700;">
<h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">üé≠ The Great Soviet Deception</h4>
<ul style="color: #e8e8e8;">
<li><strong>The Propaganda:</strong> "Communist central planning avoided capitalist crisis"</li>
<li><strong>The Reality:</strong> The Russian economy had already collapsed during the Civil War</li>
<li><strong>The Truth:</strong> You can't fall further when you're already at the bottom</li>
<li><strong>The Impact:</strong> Millions worldwide embraced communist alternatives</li>
</ul>
</div>

But this was essentially a lie. The Soviet economy hadn't avoided collapse during the Great Depression because **it had already collapsed earlier, during the Russian Civil War, and never recovered**. There was simply no lower point for it to fall to.

However, in a world desperate for answers, the Soviet narrative found incredibly receptive ears.

## üèõÔ∏è The Desperate Search for Solutions: When Democracy Fails, People Embrace "Isms"

### When People Have Nothing Left to Lose

When you have millions of people without food, without money, without work, and without hope, they start looking for radical solutions üò∞. The comfortable assumptions of liberal democracy - individual rights, free markets, gradual reform - seem like luxuries when your children are starving.

People become willing to sacrifice freedoms, embrace authoritarianism, follow strongmen - anything that promises stability, food, and jobs.

**This is how extremism takes root:** not through ideology, but through desperation.

### The Isms Explosion

The interwar period saw an explosion of political "isms" as societies searched for alternatives to failed liberal capitalism. But here's the crucial point: **the same word can mean completely different things depending on how it's implemented**.

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #6a5acd 0%, #9370db 50%, #8a2be2 100%); padding: 25px; border-radius: 15px; margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 0 8px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);">

<li>Extensive social welfare</li>
<li>High taxation for public services</li>
<li>Spectrum: Sweden to Cuba</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>

### Corporatism: The Single-Party Solution

The most successful alternative to emerge was **corporatism** - the system where one party controls all major segments of society üèõÔ∏è.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Single party rule:** Unlike democracy where different groups manage their own affairs, corporatism absorbs everything into the party structure
- **No independent institutions:** Labor unions, businesses, intellectuals, military - all controlled by the party
- **Conflict resolution:** Instead of open debate or elections, all disputes are resolved within the party hierarchy
- **Unity over freedom:** Prioritizes national strength and unity over individual liberty

**Examples include:**
- **Italy:** Mussolini's Fascists (from *fasci* - bundle of sticks symbolizing strength through unity)
- **Germany:** Hitler's Nazis
- **Spain:** Franco's Falangists
- **Latin America:** Peronismo in Argentina, Estado Novo in Brazil
- **Mexico:** The PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) - lasted 80 years!

<li><strong>Mexican saying:</strong> "God dies every six years" (new president every 6 years)</li>
<li><strong>Key insight:</strong> Power resided in the party, not individual leaders</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Stability and peace, but at the cost of democratic choice</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Populism: The Appeal to "Common Folk"

**Populism** simply means appealing to the interests of ordinary people against corrupt elites or external threats. But it comes in two very different flavors:

**üèõÔ∏è Democratic Populism:** Power to the people through collective action and democratic processes (think labor unions, socialist movements)

**üë§ Authoritarian Populism:** One strongman who will fix everything for everybody through force of will, bypassing traditional institutions

**The Hitler Example:** He was genuinely popular because he appeared to deliver results - zero unemployment, national purpose, economic recovery. But the cost was the complete destruction of legal and constitutional safeguards.

**The crucial danger:** If the people support the strongman, then law and constitution become meaningless. Popular support can override everything - minority rights, individual freedoms, institutional checks and balances.

## üåç American Isolationism: The World's Policeman Takes a Vacation

### The Great Withdrawal

After helping win World War I only to face massive depression, Americans decided: **"Never again"** üá∫üá∏‚ùå. 

This wasn't just a feeling - it was **codified into law** through the Neutrality Acts. Congress, controlled by Republicans, literally tied the President's hands to prevent him from getting America involved in another European war.

**The restrictions included:**
- No arms sales to belligerent nations
- No loans to countries at war
- No American travel to war zones
- Complete isolation from European conflicts

### The League of Nations: Paper Tiger

Without American participation, **the League of Nations became toothless** ü¶∑‚ùå. When aggressive nations began acting out, the League could condemn but couldn't enforce. Its warnings were empty words.

**This sent a clear signal to potential aggressors:** There would be little unified resistance to their actions. It was essentially an **open invitation to do whatever you want**.

---

## üóæ Japan's Pacific Gamble: Resources Through Conquest

### The Island Nation's Dilemma

Japan faced a problem similar to Britain: **an industrial economy on islands with insufficient natural resources** ‚õΩ. They needed oil, iron ore, rubber, and other raw materials to keep their factories running and their people fed.

Their solution to the Depression? **Get resources through conquest** rather than trade.

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #8b0000 0%, #ff4500 50%, #ffd700 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 5px solid #dc143c;">
<h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">üóæ Japan's Imperial Strategy</h4>
<ul style="color: #2c1810;">
<li><strong>1931:</strong> Invade Manchuria for coal and iron</li>
<li><strong>1937:</strong> Full-scale invasion of China</li>
<li><strong>1940:</strong> Move into French Indochina for rubber and oil</li>
<li><strong>The Goal:</strong> Control enough Pacific territory to support Japanese industry</li>
</ul>
</div>

### The American Economic Chokehold

The United States watched this expansion with growing alarm. America had significant Pacific interests and saw Japan as an economic rival. More importantly, **the US was Japan's primary supplier** of the raw materials Japan desperately needed.

When Japan continued expanding, **Roosevelt imposed a crippling oil embargo** in mid-1941. This was essentially economic warfare - Japan's industrial economy couldn't survive without American oil.

### Pearl Harbor: The Desperate Gamble

Facing economic strangulation, Japan made a **breathtakingly audacious decision** ‚úàÔ∏èüí•. Their plan was to conquer the entire Pacific in one swift campaign before America could respond effectively.

They believed America was weakened by the Depression and constrained by isolationist laws. **Just in case, they decided to bomb Pearl Harbor** to knock the US Pacific Fleet out of action.

**The logic:** Recreate their successful 1904 surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur, but on a much larger scale.

**The result:** Instead of demoralizing America, they **awakened a sleeping giant** and thrust the US directly into World War II.

---

## üá©üá™ Germany: From Humiliation to Horror

### The Festering Wound of Versailles

Germany in the 1920s was a nation seething with **resentment and humiliation** üò°. The Treaty of Versailles had:
- Forced Germany to accept total responsibility for WWI
- Imposed massive reparations
- Stripped away German territory 
- Limited their military to 100,000 men
- Forbidden them an air force or submarines

When the Depression hit, Germans blamed the democratic **Weimar Republic** that had signed this "stab in the back" treaty.

### Hitler's Blueprint for Revenge

**Adolf Hitler** expertly exploited this resentment. While imprisoned after his failed 1923 coup attempt, he wrote **Mein Kampf** - a chilling blueprint that laid out his entire plan:

1. **Repudiate Versailles** - tear up the hated treaty
2. **Reclaim lost territories** - rebuild German power
3. **Unite all German-speaking peoples** - create Greater Germany  
4. **Invade the East** for *Lebensraum* (living space)
5. **Exterminate "inferior races"** - particularly Slavic peoples and Jews

**The terrifying part:** It was all there in writing for anyone who cared to read it.

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #2c1810 0%, #8b4513 50%, #654321 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 5px solid #ff6347;">
<h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">üìñ Mein Kampf: The Warning Nobody Heeded</h4>
<ul style="color: #e8e8e8;">
<li><strong>Volume 1 (1925):</strong> Outlined racial ideology and anti-Semitism</li>
<li><strong>Volume 2 (1926):</strong> Detailed plans for European conquest</li>
<li><strong>Core Premise:</strong> Germans are master race deserving global dominance</li>
<li><strong>The Tragedy:</strong> It was all there for the world to see</li>
</ul>
</div>

### The Success That Made Him Dangerous

Hitler became genuinely popular because **he appeared to solve Germany's immediate problems** üìà:
- **Zero unemployment** through massive public works projects
- **National pride** restored through military parades and rallies
- **Economic recovery** through rearmament and infrastructure spending
- **Unity and purpose** in a nation that had felt defeated and divided

**This is the seductive power of authoritarian populism:** When democracy seems to fail, strongmen who get results can become irresistible to desperate people.

### Mussolini's Precedent: Testing the Waters

Before Hitler took power, **Benito Mussolini** had already established the template in Italy üáÆüáπ. His fascist movement had restored order (making the trains run on time became a metaphor for efficiency), but like other leaders, he couldn't solve the global Depression within Italy's borders alone.

**His solution:** Start a war. In October 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia.

**The League of Nations' response:** Weak, ineffective economic sanctions. Critically, they **failed to impose an oil embargo** that might have stopped the invasion.

**The message to Hitler:** The Western powers have no stomach for serious resistance to aggression.

---

## üî• The Road to September 1, 1939

### The Green Lights for Aggression

Each successful act of aggression sent signals to other potential aggressors:

1. **Japan invades Manchuria (1931):** League condemns but takes no action
2. **Italy invades Ethiopia (1935):** Weak sanctions, no oil embargo  
3. **Germany remilitarizes Rhineland (1936):** Britain and France do nothing
4. **Germany annexes Austria (1938):** Appeasement continues
5. **Germany takes Czechoslovakia (1938-39):** More appeasement

**Each success emboldened the next aggression.**

### The American Exception

While the rest of the world embraced radical alternatives - fascism, militarism, authoritarianism, communism - **the United States chose a different path** üá∫üá∏.

Instead of abandoning liberal capitalism, **Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal** attempted to **save capitalism** through reform:
- Social Security for elderly
- FDIC insurance for bank deposits  
- Works Progress Administration for employment
- Civilian Conservation Corps for youth jobs
- Banking regulations to prevent speculation

**By 1939, America stood almost alone as the only major liberal democratic, capitalist country left in the world.**

## ü§î Contemporary Parallels: The Fragility of Democracy

### Economic Crisis and Political Extremism

The interwar period teaches us **uncomfortable truths about democracy's fragility** üèõÔ∏èüíî:

**When economic systems fail:**
- People lose faith in democratic institutions
- Extremist alternatives become attractive
- Strongmen who promise simple solutions gain support
- Constitutional safeguards can be overwhelmed by popular anger

**Modern echoes:**
- **2008 Financial Crisis:** Led to rise of populist movements globally
- **Economic inequality:** Fueling political polarization in many democracies
- **Social media:** Spreading extremist ideologies faster than ever before
- **Democratic backsliding:** Elected leaders undermining democratic institutions

### The "Isms" Return

Today we see new versions of old patterns:
- **Authoritarian populism:** Leaders claiming to represent "the people" against "elites"
- **Economic nationalism:** Turning inward when global systems seem to fail
- **Scapegoating:** Blaming problems on minority groups or foreign influences
- **Institutional capture:** Taking control of courts, media, and bureaucracy

## üìù Reflection Questions: Learning from Democracy's Darkest Hour

As we conclude this exploration of how economic collapse led to political extremism, consider these essential questions:

1. **Economic Vulnerability:** How dependent is democratic stability on economic prosperity? Can democracy survive prolonged economic hardship without transforming into something else?

2. **The Appeal of Authoritarianism:** Why do people willingly give up freedoms to strongmen during crises? What does this tell us about human psychology and political systems?

3. **International Cooperation:** How did the failure of international institutions (League of Nations) contribute to global conflict? What parallels do you see with current international challenges?

4. **The Power of Desperation:** When people are desperate enough, they'll support almost anything that promises relief. How do we address economic inequality and social problems before they reach crisis levels?

5. **Media and Propaganda:** How did radio and mass media help spread extremist ideologies in the 1930s? What role do modern media and social platforms play in political radicalization today?

6. **The Slippery Slope:** Democracy didn't die overnight in Germany or Italy - it was gradually undermined. What early warning signs should we watch for in modern democracies?

---

## üåü The Lesson We Can't Forget

The interwar years teach us the most sobering lesson in modern history: **democracy is not inevitable, permanent, or self-sustaining**. It requires active protection, economic stability, and citizens willing to defend democratic values even when times are hard.

When economic systems collapse, people don't automatically choose better economic systems. They often choose **any system that promises to work**, regardless of the cost in freedom, human rights, or long-term consequences.

**The monsters of the 1930s didn't emerge from nowhere** - they grew out of the fertile soil of economic desperation, political failure, and social breakdown. They offered simple solutions to complex problems, scapegoats for complex blame, and the promise that a strong leader could fix everything if only people would surrender their freedoms.

**The haunting question for our time:** As we face our own economic challenges, political polarization, and social tensions, how do we strengthen democratic institutions and economic systems before desperation makes extremism attractive again?

The choice between democracy and authoritarianism is never made once - it's made every day, in every crisis, by every generation. The 1930s show us what happens when enough people decide that freedom is less important than the promise of security and simple answers.

# Interwar Years Glossary

## Key Terms and Concepts

### **Appeasement**
The policy of giving in to aggressive demands in hopes of avoiding conflict. Most famously used by Britain and France when dealing with Hitler's territorial demands in the late 1930s. The strategy backfired because it encouraged further aggression.

### **Authoritarian Populism**
A political approach where a strongman leader claims to represent "the people" against corrupt elites, but concentrates power in their own hands rather than strengthening democratic institutions.

### **Bank Run**
When many customers try to withdraw their money from a bank at the same time, usually due to fears the bank might fail. Since banks don't keep all deposits as cash, this can force even healthy banks to close.

### **Corporatism**
A political system where a single party controls all major segments of society - businesses, labor unions, media, military, etc. Everything is organized under party control rather than operating independently.

### **Democratic Populism**
Political movements that empower ordinary people through collective action and democratic processes, like labor unions or grassroots political movements.

### **Dependency Theory**
The economic concept that developing "periphery" countries that export raw materials become dependent on industrialized "metropolis" countries that buy those materials and sell back manufactured goods.

### **Fascism**
A far-right, authoritarian political ideology that combines extreme nationalism, rejection of democracy, and the belief that the nation/race is more important than individual rights. Named after the Italian word "fasci" (bundle of sticks - stronger together).

### **Fractional Reserve Banking**
The banking system where banks only keep a fraction of deposits as cash reserves and lend out the rest. This works fine normally but creates problems during bank runs.

### **Great Depression**
The severe worldwide economic downturn from 1929-1939, triggered by the U.S. stock market crash. Characterized by massive unemployment, bank failures, and economic collapse.

### **Laissez-Faire**
An economic philosophy of minimal government interference in business and markets. Literally means "let it be" in French. Dominant in the 1920s until the Great Depression discredited it.

### **League of Nations**
The first international organization aimed at maintaining world peace, created after WWI. Failed because major powers (especially the U.S.) didn't join or support it effectively.

### **Lebensraum**
German word meaning "living space." Hitler's concept that Germans needed to conquer territory in Eastern Europe to have enough room and resources for their "superior" race.

### **Liberalism (Classical)**
Political philosophy emphasizing individual rights, democracy, free markets, and limited government. The dominant ideology in Western countries before the Depression challenged its assumptions.

### **Margin Trading**
Buying stocks with borrowed money. In the 1920s, you could buy $100 worth of stock with just $10 down and borrow the other $90. This amplified both gains and losses catastrophically.

### **Margin Call**
When the value of stocks bought on margin falls below a certain level, the broker demands immediate payment. This forced mass selling during the 1929 crash, making it worse.

### **Mein Kampf**
Hitler's book ("My Struggle") written while in prison, outlining his racist ideology and plans for German conquest. A blueprint for everything he later did, but mostly ignored at the time.

### **New Deal**
President Franklin Roosevelt's series of programs to combat the Great Depression through government job creation, financial reforms, and social safety nets. Represented an attempt to save capitalism through reform rather than revolution.

### **Neutrality Acts**
U.S. laws in the 1930s designed to keep America out of foreign wars by prohibiting arms sales, loans, and travel to countries at war. Reflected widespread American isolationism.

### **Populism**
Political approach that claims to represent the interests of ordinary people against corrupt elites. Can be democratic (empowering people through institutions) or authoritarian (concentrating power in a strongman).

### **Reparations**
Payments demanded from Germany after WWI to compensate the Allies for war damages. Created a circular debt system that contributed to global economic instability.

### **Treaty of Versailles**

## Important People

### **Adolf Hitler (1889-1945)**
Austrian-born leader of Nazi Germany who rose to power during the Depression by promising to restore German greatness and solve economic problems. Implemented the genocidal plans he outlined in Mein Kampf.

### **Benito Mussolini (1883-1945)**
Italian fascist leader who created the template for authoritarian populism. Rose to power promising to restore order and make Italy great, then launched aggressive wars to distract from economic problems.

## Key Concepts for Understanding

### **The Debt Balloon Cycle**
The unsustainable financial system of the 1920s where American banks lent money to Germany, Germany paid reparations to Britain and France, and Britain and France used that money to pay war debts back to American banks. When American lending stopped, the whole system collapsed.

### **Why the Soviet Union Seemed Successful**
The USSR appeared stable during the Depression because its economy had already collapsed during the Russian Civil War and couldn't fall further. This made communist central planning look more effective than it actually was.

### **The Fragility of Democracy**
The interwar period shows that democracy depends on economic stability and public faith in institutions. When these fail, people may willingly choose authoritarian alternatives that promise security over freedom.

File: 0.1 Why Do We Study History
Course: US1
---
We are Americans. We're supposed to stand up to bullies, not follow them. We're supposed to stand up to discrimination, and we're sure as heck supposed to stand up clearly and unequivocally to Nazi sympathizers. How hard can that be to say that Nazis are bad? That's a pretty powerful statement from Barack Obama back in 2018, and it really cuts right to the heart of what we're digging into today. What if you know, much of what we think we know about our past isn't quite right? And maybe, why does that matter more today than ever? So our mission here is to unpack the critical importance of history, especially for citizens in a democracy, moving beyond those comforting myths to a really critical understanding. This deep dive, it's based on a whole stack of fascinating sources, looking at memory, historical truth, and, well, the serious consequences of forgetting. It's a great starting point. Imagine, just for a second, you wake up tomorrow, total amnesia. You don't know who you are, where you came from, nothing about your past. How would you even navigate the world? You'd be completely lost, utterly vulnerable. Right? Vulnerable to manipulation. Anyone could tell you anything about who you were and you'd have no way to check it. And what's interesting is this analogy. It reveals something profound about societies. Okay, Just like individuals need personal memory to function, democratic societies, well, they absolutely need accurate historical knowledge to survive, to thrive, even without it. You are incredibly vulnerable to manipulation, just like that person with amnesia that really lands. And it highlights an interesting, maybe even a tricky aspect of American culture, doesn't it? We tend to be very forward looking. History often feels different, maybe irrelevant. Yeah, that's a common perception. But this attitude, as our sources point out, it creates a real vulnerability. Octavio Paz, the Mexican Nobel laureate, he observed something interesting in the Labyrinth of Solitude. He said, Americans look to the future with hope. Mexicans look to the past with regret. Just a stark difference, isn't it? Ignoring the past versus maybe being too burdened by it. Exactly. It's a dichotomy. And if we look outside the US take the German model, for instance. German public education, it takes a fundamentally different path with its national history. How so? They openly acknowledge responsibility for Nazi atrocities. And the specific goal is prevention, to stop anything like it from ever happening again. It, it shows that historical education can be honest, even about terrible failures, and still be incredibly constructive for citizenship. It's using history as a tool, really a preventative one. So if societies need memory like individuals do, what happens when that memory is flawed or Worse when it's deliberately twisted. Right. This is about understanding how historians work, how you, the listener, can distinguish myth from reality, and how to learn from all that complexity. This kind of critical thinking, it's not just for academics. It's. Well, it's essential for a democracy to actually function. Okay, let's start with an idea that might feel a bit provocative. When we think about, say, the Boston Tea Party, are we thinking about history or are we thinking about a deeply ingrained national myth? Hmm, good question. And the difference between those two things, it's profound. A lot of what many of us learned in school, you know, elementary, high school, it's often a simplified version, sanitized maybe, designed to make us feel patriotic pride, which isn't necessarily bad in itself. No, pride isn't bad. But when it's based on these incomplete, sugar coated stories, it leaves citizens, well, not really equipped to handle complexity. It makes you vulnerable to manipulation. Take the Boston Tea Party example. The popular image is so strong, isn't it? Noble patriots, heroes dumping tea in the harbor to protest tyranny. The Sons of Liberty, clear cut heroes fighting for freedom. It's a powerful story. It is. But what's fascinating is the historical reality behind it. The Sons of Liberty, historians call them an extralegal group, meaning they operated outside the established legal system. They often defied the law. Okay, so not exactly following the rules. Not at all. And many respectable colonists back then actually saw them as dangerous thugs, not patriots. Their tactics, well, they included things like tarring and feathering people, burning the governor in effigy, destroying his house, stealing property, sinking ships. Yeah, even throwing rocks at soldiers. It really makes you question how we define heroic, doesn't it? That is a very different picture from the schoolbook version. Yeah, it wasn't just a fringe opinion. No, definitely not. Even the big names, the founders, they disagreed about the Sons of Liberty's methods. John Adams, he thought the Tea Party was magnificent. Absolutely necessary. But Benjamin Franklin, he was so worried about it, he offered to personally pay the East India Company back for all the tea they destroyed. Wow, really? Yeah. And George Washington, privately, he called the Bostonians mad. He really disapproved of destroying private property. And get this, some towns in Massachusetts actually passed formal condemnations of the Tea Party, calling it illegal and unjust. So it's hardly a simple, unified story. Okay, so when we look at that messy reality, the violence, the controversy, the disagreement, and then we see modern movements using the Sons of Liberty as straightforward heroes, what should that tell us? It tells us that historical myths, even Ones that seem pretty harmless can absolutely be weaponized in politics today. Think about the modern Tea Party movement that popped up around 2009. Right? I remember that they explicitly linked themselves to the Boston Tea Party Patriots. They claimed that heroic legacy, but often conveniently ignored the violent, highly controversial parts of what the original Sons of Liberty actually did you see it even now? Right? Yeah. Modern movements using colonial imagery, Those tricorn hats, the Don't Tread on Me flags, calling themselves Patriots, they're trying to legitimize their actions by wrapping themselves in that founding spirit of resistance. Exactly. But if you don't understand the full story, the complex, sometimes violent reality of the original Sons of Liberty, you're just buying into a myth. You can't really evaluate their claims properly, can you? You really can't. And stepping back a bit, this danger of historical ignorance, it goes way beyond misunderstanding. Colonial protests. When citizens don't have that deeper historical knowledge, they become vulnerable to what some political scientists call historical manipulation. Okay, what does that mean exactly? It's the deliberate distortion of the past to serve some present day political agenda. It can be, you know, creating false nostalgia for the good old days, which maybe weren't so good for everyone. Or it can be completely fabricating historical narratives to back up a political argument today. Here's another common one, especially lately. This idea of Judeo Christian values being the foundation of the U.S. now that narrator has a lot of political traction for some groups, right? But the historical evidence, it points somewhere else. The key founding documents, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution that came directly out of the European Enlightenment. The Age of Reason, not a specifically religious framework. So thinkers like Locke. Precisely. And the authors themselves, Jefferson, Franklin, Adams, they were largely Deists or Unitarians. They believed in a creator, sure, but more like a first cause, a divine architect, maybe not necessarily the interventionist God of traditional Christianity who reveals divine truth directly. A really crucial distinction. When you actually read the Declaration, it talks about self evident truths and unalienable rights. Those are Enlightenment concepts, Right? Rooted in thinkers like John Locke, his Second Treatise of Government. Exactly. And the Constitution itself is even more striking in how it handles religion. How so? It only mentions religion generally, never Christianity specifically. And crucially, the mentions are only there to limit, actually to prohibit, the role of religion in government. Think separation of church and state. It's a document built squarely on Enlightenment principles. This lack of understanding, this historical ignorance, it creates a real challenge. Abraham Lincoln saw this back in 1862. He said the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. He Meant, you know, just knowing facts isn't enough. We have to actively apply historical lessons to the problems we face now. But then he also gave this really powerful warning which we cannot escape. History. Which sounds a bit ominous. Well, it wasn't just saying the past sticks with us. It was a recognition that we are actively making history right now through our actions, our decisions and future generations. They're going to judge us on what we do or what we fail to do in our own critical moments. And sometimes the most tragic parts of history offer the clearest blueprints for avoiding disaster in the future. Think about the rise of Nazi Germany. It's just a devastating example of how fast democratic institutions can crumble when people aren't historically aware. It happened incredibly quickly, didn't it? Astonishingly fast. Within months of Hitler taking power, the regime suspended basic civil liberties. They ended parliamentary democracy with the Enabling Act. That essentially gave Hitler dictatorial powers. They set up a massive surveillance. State universities lost academic freedom, Independent journalism was crushed. And truth itself, it became a casualty through systematic, relentless propaganda and the human cost that followed, it's almost unimaginable. Catastrophic is the only word. The regime's racist ideology, its aggressive expansionism, it led directly to World War II. The result for Germany, between 4.3 and 5.3 million German military deaths. Another 400,000 to 600,000 German civilians killed in Allied bombing rates. Plus, Germany permanently lost about a quarter of its pre war territory. Just devastating for Germany itself. Absolutely. But the devastation of course, spread far beyond Germany. The war demanded enormous sacrifices from the Allied nations who had to step in to stop Nazi brutality. Over 400,000American military personnel died, more than 450,000 British deaths, millions more from other allies. The ultimate lesson, it's crystal clear extremist ideology. Once it gets real power, it doesn't just destroy its targets, it destroys the very society that embraces it. It. And it demands terrible, terrible sacrifices from those who have to restore peace and justice. Hearing that harrowing example, you can't help but wonder, are we seeing echoes today? Mark Twain supposedly said, history doesn't repeat, but it often rhymes. People seem to make similar mistakes, often because they just don't know the past. And there's this idea that collective memory only really lasts about two generations. Anything older gets fuzzy, forgotten. Which brings us to a really important question. What are we seeing today? The recent data, well, it reveals some genuinely alarming trends that do seem to echo past patterns. FBI hate crime stats hit an all time high in 2023. 800, 862 incidents that's a 99% increase just since 2015. 99%. That's staggering. It is. The Department of Homeland Security identifies white supremacist extremism as the most persistent domestic terror threat. Attacks linked to the far right quadrupled between 2016 and 2017 alone. And anti Semitic incidents, 8873 in 2023. That's 140% increase from the year before and the highest number ever recorded. Those numbers are truly chilling. They are indeed. And these statistics become even more concerning when you look at them through the lens of something the Irish columnist Fintan o' Toole calls trial runs for fascism. Trial runs? What does he mean by that? He argues that fascism doesn't just suddenly appear in established democracy. It needs systematic efforts to desensitize people, to get societies used to increasing levels of cruelty and dehumanization. These test markets, as he calls them, serve two purposes. First, they get people accustomed to things they might initially recoil from. Second, they let those pushing these ideas refine their methods, see what works. And this is exactly where understanding history gives you, the listener, an incredible advantage. It helps you recognize these patterns when they show up. Absolutely. Whether it's the deliberate dehumanization of certain groups using language like vermin or infestation station to describe people, or systematic attacks on democratic institutions, on the free press, on truth itself. History provides the framework. It helps you spot the warning signs and the need for this historical literacy. It's becoming even more urgent. Right now, we're facing what historians might call a critical juncture. The generation with firsthand living memory of Nazi atrocities of World War II. They're rapidly passing away. Right. The number of survivors diminishes each year. Exactly. Think about it. Only about 50 Holocaust survivors were able to attend the 80th anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation recently. Ten years earlier, at the 70th anniversary, there were 300. As these direct witnesses disappear, extremist leaders can exploit that memory vacuum. They fill the void with disported narratives that might appeal to younger generations who lack that firsthand knowledge of where these ideologies ultimately lead. And the timing is undeniable, isn't it? Yeah. This demographic shift is happening at the exact same time that according to EU officials, we're seeing the highest levels of antisemitism since the Holocaust. The pattern is clear. As firsthand memory fades, these dangerous old ideologies resurface. They might be dressed up differently, but they follow those familiar, dangerous historical patterns that someone with historical literacy would recognize. And this is Precisely why understanding history and understanding how historians work isn't just some academic exercise. It's a vital tool, a tool for active citizenship, for positive change. Real historical knowledge lets you recognize manipulation. It helps you learn from past mistakes, and it gives you the grounding to stand firm against dangerous ideologies. But it's more than just defense. It empowers you to become an agent of progress, armed with the analytical tools you need to improve the present and build a better future. Yeah, and here's where it gets really practical for you. Listening. Studying history gives you tangible skills, skills that translate directly into being an effective citizen. When you learn how to evaluate sources critically, how to tell the difference between myth and reality, how to understand the complex causes behind big events. You're building an essential toolkit. Exactly. You're developing the intellectual tools you need to navigate today's political and social challenges. You learn to ask those crucial questions. Okay, who benefits from this particular story? What's the actual evidence supporting these claims? What are the likely long term consequences if we go down this path? These are the exact same questions effective citizens need to ask about current events, about policy proposals. It's incredibly empowering. And you know, the American founders, they understood something really profound about their own historical moment. When they wrote the Declaration and the Constitution, they weren't just thinking about themselves or the people alive right then. No, they had a longer view. They explicitly recognized their duty to what they called millions yet unborn future generations. People who would inherit the consequences of the decisions they were making right then. That vision, that sense of intergenerational responsibility, really should inspire us today. They were basically historians themselves, weren't they? Yeah. They actively drew on their understanding of classical history. The Greeks, the Romans, the English Civil War, Enlightenment philosophy. They used all that to try and create something new, something that would last. Right. They studied the rise and fall of earlier republics. They learned from the mistakes of past attempts at democracy, and they deliberately designed institutions they hoped would endure across generations. That same sense of ditty, that historical awareness, it should really drive how we approach our challenges today, shouldn't it? Absolutely. We are not just passive bystanders watching history unfold. We are active participants. We are making history right now. The climate crisis, massive technological disruption, deep social inequality, the threats to democratic institutions we see around the world, these are the issues that will define our generation's legacy. Historical study equips us. It gives us the wisdom, hopefully drawn from past experience, to tackle these problems effectively and crucially, avoid the mistakes that led to past failures. And that's actually really empowering. I think history shows us that change isn't just possible, it's kind of inevitable. When you study how previous generations faced down challenges that must have seemed completely overwhelming at the time, you realize our problems aren't necessarily insurmountable either. Exactly. The founders didn't just accept the political system they inherited. They studied history to figure out why previous governments had failed. And they used that knowledge to try and design better ones. They understood that democracy isn't a finished product. It needs constant vigilance, constant improvement, not just passive acceptance. Let me give you a really concrete example of how this works in practice. When you understand the historical pattern of dehumanizing language, how it was used against indigenous peoples during westward expansion, or the rhetoric that paved the way for Japanese American internment during World War II, or, of course, Nazi propaganda against Jewish people, you gain the analytical tools to recognize similar patterns when they appear today. And that knowledge isn't just passive, it can lead directly to action. Maybe you start fact checking inflammatory social media posts before you even think about sharing them. Maybe you write a letter to your local newspaper when you hear a politician using that kind of dehumanizing language. Maybe you help organize an educational event in your community to push back against historical misinformation. You shift from being just a passive consumer of narratives to an active guardian of democratic discourse. So to kind of pull this all together, understanding history, understanding historical methods, it empowers you. It makes you more than just an informed observer. It transforms you into potentially an active agent of positive change. When you get these tools of historical analysis, you gain this ability to see beyond the surface explanations, right? To understand the deeper causes, the deep causes of social problems, and maybe even envision practical solutions that are grounded in historical precedent, in actual human experience. And that historical literacy, it empowers you to ask the hard questions, to see beyond those overly simplified, often misleading narratives, to make genuinely informed decisions. It gives you the tools to distinguish between legitimate political arguments and, frankly, dangerous distortions. And maybe most importantly, it reminds us all that history isn't just something that happened back then. No, it's happening now. It's being made by us right now, through our choices, our actions, our inactions, too. Like the poet Amanda Gorman put it so beautifully, while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. Future generations will look back and judge us based on what we knew, or maybe what we should have known about the lessons history offers and this responsibility. It's also an incredible opportunity. Armed with historical knowledge, with these analytical tools, we can actually act deliberately. We can work to create the kind of future we want to leave for those millions yet unborn the Founders talked about. In a democracy, ultimately, an informed citizenry is the best safeguard against repeating historical disasters. By studying history, by understanding its methods, we equip ourselves not just to remember the past or defend against its worst echoes, but to actively, consciously create a better future. The Founders understood the responsibility to history. Do we.

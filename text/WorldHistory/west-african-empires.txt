File: West African Empires and the Transatlantic World
Course: US1

Welcome to the deep dive. We're the place you come to get well, really informed on complex topics and fast. Exactly. Today we're inviting you on a bit of a journey back in time to West Africa. It's a region that honestly was just teeming with powerful empires, complex trade networks. Really intricate. Yeah. And their influence. It shaped global history in ways that might actually surprise you much more than you might initially think. Absolutely. So for this deep dive, our mission really is to unpack the rise and fall of three incredibly influential West African kingdoms. Right. We're talking Ghana, Mali, and Songhai. Okay. We'll get into their wealth, which was immense. Their political structures, their cultural interactions, too, especially with Islam. And then we're going to pivot a bit to talk about slavery. Yeah. Crucial topic. We need to understand its historical foundations, maybe differentiate it from how we often perceive it now. Right. The sort of common perceptions. And then finally, we'll look at the. Well, the dramatic emergence and the really devastating impact of the transatlantic slave trade. Devastating. And you mentioned asymmetrical. Deeply asymmetrical, yes. On both Africa and Europe. Okay. And to help us navigate all this, we're drawing on a whole range of historical sources. Good stuff. Detailed maps, rich historical accounts. So we get a proper multifaceted view. That's the goal. A really full picture of this critical period. Okay, let's dive in. Let's do it. So to really get West Africa, you first have to kind of zoom out and see the whole continent. Africa. It's huge. It's enormous. Way bigger than it looks on most maps. And incredibly diverse. We're talking thousands of different groups, languages, ethnic identities. It's quite a mosaic. Yeah. It's easy to forget that patchwork nature, especially back then around, say, 1500 CE. Exactly. The world wasn't these big nation states like today. It was mostly local power centers. And Africa's geography played a huge role. The Sahara, like an ocean of sand, as traders called it, but with ancient routes crisscrossing it for centuries. A barrier. Yes, but also a connector. And south of that, the Sahel. Right. The plains, the grasslands kind of transitioning into forests as you get closer to the coast. That Sahel region, that's mostly where we'll be focusing. Okay, so first empire. Ghana. Ghana. It really rose to prominence around a thousand CE, maybe hit its peak in the 14th century. And its power, fundamentally rooted in wealth, Just immense wealth. So this golden rule idea, how did they actually, you know, leverage that wealth? How did they control trade across that huge, tough landscape? Well, Ghana's Real strength wasn't just having gold, though. They had plenty. It was their strategic position. They managed to monopolize the whole trans Saharan trade flow. The entire flow? Pretty much. Gold, salt, and yes, slaves, too. They didn't just dig stuff up. They controlled the market. They turned their geography into, well, geopolitical power. And salt, it seems odd, but it was really valuable, Incredibly valuable in West Africa. Very scarce south of the Sahara. So, yeah, it was basically like money. And Ghana controlled key salt sources, too. That really cemented their dominance. Okay, and what about Islam? It's spreading down from North Africa around this time. How does that fit in? Islam definitely had a significant presence, you know, by 11,000 CE, and it brought something vital, a written language, Arabic. Which West African cultures mostly didn't have before. Largely, no. But it's important to remember, while Islam was there and tolerated, even adopted by some rulers, it wasn't the main religion for everyone. Not for the majority, no. Most people kept practicing various animistic religions. You know, belief systems focused on spirits and nature, that sort of thing. It was often the rulers, the elites who converted for political reasons. Economic ties. Exactly. Connecting with the wider Islamic trading world was a big advantage. And the key trading cities, Jena, Timbuktu, Gao, they were the hubs. Absolutely. Central control, those cities. You basically controlled West Africa for centuries. That was the logic that. But Ghana didn't last forever. What started its decline? It was kind of a mix of things. Rival trade routes started popping up, bypassing the cities. Ghana control. So revenue drops. Then you had constant raids. Nomadic Berber tribesmen from the Sahara. The pirates of the desert. Yeah. Basically they lived by raiding caravans, settlements. A constant pressure and internal factors. Or religious ones. Yes. Finally, there was pressure from a group called the Almoravids, Muslim fundamentalists, originally from Morocco. They wanted to impose a stricter, more literal form of Islam. Their campaigns put a huge strain on Ghana, and eventually it just sort of fragmented into smaller kingdoms. So Ghana fades. And stepping into that vacuum, Mali. Mali, yeah. Started as a smaller kingdom within Ghana, actually, but it broke away, defeated Ghana, and took over those key trading cities along the Niger River. And Mali was even bigger. Bigger than Ghana. Yeah. And crucially, controlled even more gold mines. So unbelievably wealthy. Which brings us to Mansa Musa, the legend. Mansa meaning ruler of Mali. And yes, often claimed to be the richest person in history. Adjusted for inflation, maybe $400 billion. It's a staggering number. Just hard to wrap your head around. That pilgrimage to Mecca, the Hajj, around 1324. It sounds almost mythical. It was an enormous undertaking. I mean, imagine the logistics. An entourage, they say, of 12,000 private slave women. 12,000 dressed in brocade silk. Plus 300 camels, each loaded down with gold. Wow. And his generosity, it actually had this ripple effect. When he passed through Cairo, he gave away so much gold, but the market crashed, completely collapsed. The market value of gold took years to recover. It really shows the scale we're talking about. But was it just, you know, showing off, or was there a strategic angle to that, Hodge? Oh, definitely strategic. It wasn't just personal piety or flaunting wealth. It put Molly firmly on the map globally, cemented its reputation. The ruler's power and piety attracted attention. Exactly. Traders, scholars. And on his way back, he didn't just come home. He bought camel loads of books, recruited scholars. Ah. Investing back into the empire heavily, building mosques, schools, especially in Timbuktu. Really diversifying the empire's sort of economic and social base. And where did all this imperial wealth actually come from? Was it just the gold mines? Mostly it came from taxation, taxing the immense trade that flowed through the empire. Not just, you know, Mansa Musa trading himself, but taxing all the trade. Right. Controlling the flow again. But even Mali, this powerhouse, it declined too. Why? Well, like a lot of big agricultural empires, eventually Mali's farming base maybe couldn't quite keep up with the growing power and population resource limitations, kind of. Plus those ongoing challenges. Nomads raiding other kingdoms, pushing back. Yeah, it's tough to hold such a vast territory together. And eventually. Eventually the rise of another power from the south. The Songhai. They would ultimately lead to Mali's fall. Okay, so Songhai, the third big empire. Yeah, and the largest. The largest of the three. Yeah. Became independent from mali after about 1355. But it really expanded under a leader named Sunni Ali around 1468. And he grabbed those same key cities, seized the trading cities. Yeah. Built the empire that was really dominant around 1500 CE. Songhai controlled trade, too. Slaves, salt. Slaves and salt, yes. But here's a crucial shift. They started losing control of the gold trade to the Portuguese. Portuguese? How did they manage that? Weren't the routes through the Sahara? They were, but the Portuguese had started exploring down the West African coast by sea back in 1441. Ah, bypassing the land routes. Exactly. They were slowly gaining direct sea access to the gold producing areas. And that really started to undermine Songhai's economic power base. So less gold revenue. What else weakened Songhai? Internal conflicts, always a factor in big empires. Challenges from subject kings. Wanting more autonomy. Standard imperial problems. Pretty much. But the really striking thing, the final blow came from Morocco. Morocco again? Yes, but this time it was different. Songhai had this massive army. We're talking huge numbers, maybe 300,000 people, 20,000 cavalry. Okay, sounds formidable. But Morocco attacked with these, well, comparatively tiny armies and won decisively. How? That seems completely counterintuitive. European weapons, specifically guns. Morocco's small force, equipped with firearms, basically annihilated Songhai's huge but traditionally armed army. Wow, that's significant. It was more than significant. It was, you could say, an omen. A chilling preview of what was coming globally. How so? It showed that military technology, not just sheer numbers, was now the key to power. For centuries, Europeans couldn't really penetrate deep into Africa. The climate, disease, local power. Right. But after 1500, European weapons started changing that equation. They allowed encroachment into areas that were previously inaccessible. It marked a real shift, a new era of, well, potential world domination based on military tech. Sobering thought. And that leads us directly into the next part of our discussion. Slavery and the transatlantic world. Right. And it's a really complex and often frankly, uncomfortable topic. Definitely. And before we get into the transatlantic trade specifically, it's important to understand the context. Right. Slavery wasn't new. Not at all. Slavery in some form, existed in nearly every culture across the globe. Historically. But and this is crucial, it was often very different from the specific kind of race based chattel slavery that developed in the Americas. Okay, so pre transatlantic African slavery, what did that look like? Well, first, it wasn't initially based on race. Slaves were often captives taken in war, or maybe people convicted of crimes. And in many African societies, wealth wasn't so much about owning land privately, but about controlling the labor needed to make land productive. So people were the wealth in a sense? In a way, yes. Control over labor and the roles of slaves varied. It wasn't just field labor. Absolutely. Slaves could be farmers. Yes. But also administrators, soldiers, even high level advisors, in some cases personal servants, miners working the golden salt. And could they deem freedom, was it hereditary? That's another key difference. Often slaves could be assimilated into the kinship group, into the family or community. Over time, they could potentially gain freedom, gain honor, maybe within a generation. It wasn't necessarily a permanent inherited status like chattel slavery. Interesting. Even mention the word slave itself. Right. It comes from Slav people from southeastern Europe. And sometimes they were highly regarded military slaves, like the Janissaries in the Ottoman Empire. So again, reinforcing that, it wasn't always tied to A specific race or seen as inherently degrading in the same way. Exactly. The context really matters. And this kind of slavery, it fueled the trans Saharan trade for centuries. A continuous trade, yes. From the sahel region north across the desert into the Mediterranean world, Asia, Europe, Going back way before the Roman empire, right up to the 1500s. And the numbers, the estimates are huge, but over a very long time, Maybe up to 10 million people over roughly 2,000 years. 10 million. That's a vast number. It is. But it's really important to contrast both the total volume and, crucially, the rate with what came later, with the transatlantic trade, which would eclipse it dramatically in scale and intensity and over a much shorter period. So what was the catalyst? What changed to make the Atlantic trade explode like that? Technology, Primarily Portuguese navigation tech. In the 15th century. Better ships, better navigation allowed them to sail reliably away from the coast out into the Atlantic, which led them to discover and then exploit islands. Madeira, the canaries, Cape Verde. And they enslaved the people there. They did. And then by 1441, they started trading directly along the west African coast itself. By 1460, just a couple of decades later, they were already transporting about 500 slaves a year back to iberia, to Portugal and Spain. And a really crucial point here you mentioned earlier is who was doing the capturing Initially, yes. It's vital to understand this. Initially, the slaves being sold to the Europeans were captured and sold by other Africans. The Europeans couldn't just march inland and grab people. Not really, no. They didn't have the power, the numbers, the disease resistance at this early stage, to penetrate deep into the continent, they were largely confined to coastal forts and trading posts. So they were buying slaves who were already enslaved, Often as a result of local wars? Initially, yes. The supply came from existing patterns of warfare between different African groups. But then the dynamic shifted dangerously as selling slaves to the Europeans became more and more profitable. Incredibly lucrative. In fact. African groups started fighting in order to get captives. Precisely. It changed from slavery being a byproduct of warfare to warfare being waged specifically to generate slaves for the Atlantic trade. Wow. That's a horrifying transformation from slavery as a result of war to war as a result of slavery. It dramatically escalated the scale and brutality of the whole thing. What drove that? What were the Europeans trading that made it so attractive? European manufactured goods were highly desired. Textiles, metalware, but particularly guns. Ah, the guns again created this destructive feedback loop. Sell slaves, get guns. Use guns to capture more slaves from your neighbor. Sell those slaves, get more guns. The slave gun cycle. It's often called that. Yeah. It gave kingdoms that participated an edge over those that didn't, Forcing more groups into the trade just to survive. And then the destination shifted. Not just iberia anymore. Right. By the 1520s, the Portuguese started shipping slaves Directly across the atlantic and to the americas, Primarily brazil. Initially, Brazil became the largest destination. Over time, didn't it? Historically, yes. Received the largest number of enslaved africans. And this expansion was obviously tied up with european colonialism in the americas. Absolutely. The spanish, especially, carving out huge empires in central and south america. They needed labor, lots of it. For mines, plantations. Mines, sugar plantations, Other agriculture. Initially, they tried to use forced indigenous labor, the encomienda system. But that didn't work out long term. Two big problems. One, European diseases absolutely devastated the native populations. Catastrophic declines. Two, the indigenous people knew the land they could escape more easily. They resisted. Managing them was difficult. So they looked for an alternative labor source. And tragically, enslaved africans became that alternative. Imported, unfamiliar with the land, Racially distinct, Easier to control in their brutal calculus. And wasn't there some kind of debate in spain about the morality of enslaving indigenous people? Yes, the Valladolid debate, mid 16th century, a famous debate about whether indios, as they called them, were fully human, had souls. And the outcome, the eventual decision, Was essentially, yes, they were human. Which somewhat paradoxically, led to laws against their enslavement, which then increased the demand for african slaves. Exactly. It shifted the perceived legitimacy of forced labor onto africans. And the spanish crown controlled this trade tightly. They set up a monopoly contract called the asiento, Basically the exclusive right to sell slaves in the spanish americas. And other countries wanted in on that. Oh, yeah. It was hugely profitable. Eventually, after a war, the british got the asiento in 1713, which made Britain the dominant slave trading power for much of the 18th century. For the peak century of the trade. Yeah. And all this fed into what we call the triangular trade. Can you break that down? Sure. It's this three legged network. Leg one, European ships sail to africa Carrying manufactured goods. Guns, textiles, rum, metal goods. Okay. They trade these goods on the african coast for captured africans, for slaves. That's leg two, the horrific middle passage, Transporting slaves across the atlantic to the americas under absolutely brutal conditions. Then in the americas, they sell the surviving slaves and load up the ships with the products of slave labor. Sugar, molasses, tobacco, cotton, Mined metals. Right. Leg three, Take those raw materials back to europe, where they're processed into manufactured goods, which can then be taken back to africa to trade for more slaves. And the Cycle continues, generating enormous profits at multiple points. And the type of slavery in the Americas, you said it was different Chattel slavery? Fundamentally different. Chattel means property. Slaves were legally considered movable property, like livestock. Dehumanized. And it was hereditary. Lifelong, yes. Children born to enslaved mothers were automatically slaves. It was perpetual, race based and incredibly brutal. They were often treated literally like machines. Machines? How so? Worked until exhaustion. Particularly in places like the Caribbean sugar plantations. The average life expectancy after arrival might only be six or seven years. That's appalling. And then often they weren't even freed in old age, Just no longer fed or maintained by the owner. Once they couldn't work, considered used up, then replaced with newly purchased slaves. It was a horrifyingly cold economic calculation. The sheer scale of this transatlantic trade. The numbers are just staggering. They really are. The best estimates range from about 12 to 15 million Africans forcibly transported across the Atlantic over roughly 400 years. 12 to 15 million who survived the journey. Exactly. That doesn't count the millions more who died during capture, during the march to the coast, Waiting in forts, or during the middle passage itself. And tracking the exact number is hard, Especially later in the 19th century when the trade was gradually outlawed. Smuggling meant records are incomplete or non existent. But even the low estimates are enormous. And comparing that again to the trans Saharan trade, 10 million over two millennia versus 12 plus million in just four centuries. The rate, the intensity was vastly greater in the Atlantic system. And the profits generated, where did they go? Well, as we noted, some African traders and kingdoms involved certainly profited handsomely, as historians put it. Much of the wealth and power consolidation in parts of West Africa during this period was disturbingly linked to this trade. But the lion's share went elsewhere. Overwhelmingly, Europe acquired enormous wealth from the products of slave labor in the Americas. It wasn't the only factor, but it was a fundamental contributor to Europe's economic rise and eventual global dominance. While for sub Saharan Africa, the impact was profoundly negative. Devastating. First, sheer depopulation. Millions, mostly young men and women in their prime, Extracted from societies, Weakening kingdoms, communities, leaving them vulnerable, Disrupting agriculture, social structures. And this leads to what some historians call undevelopment. Undevelopment, meaning going backwards? Essentially, yeah. A receding of the levels of societal complexity and development that had been achieved during the earlier empires like Ghana, Mali or Songhai. Regions were just drained of people, vitality potential. And that slave gun cycle just perpetuated it. It was part of a much larger complex trade network. But yes, that cycle was a key destructive element fueling Conflict and instability alongside the extraction of people. So quite a journey we've taken from these, you know, incredibly rich, complex West African empires built on gold and salt, thriving centers of trade and culture through the really difficult, nuanced history of slavery itself, and then into the devastating emergence of the transatlantic trade and its profoundly asymmetric impacts. Wealth accumulating massively in Europe while contributing to deep problems and, yes, undevelopment in Africa. It really highlights those hidden connections in global history, doesn't it? And how choices made centuries ago, the power dynamics, they still echo today. Absolutely. Understanding these huge historical shifts, the rise and fall of empires, the transformation of trade, the brutal logic of the slave economy, it's fundamental to grasping the world we're in now. The inequalities, the relationships between continents. So much has roots back here. Okay, so as we wrap up this deep dive, maybe a final thought for you, our listener, to consider. Think about this connection, the historical undevelopment of sub Saharan Africa happening at the same time as this massive accumulation of wealth in Europe, largely driven by forced labor. How might that legacy continue to shape, maybe subtly, maybe not so subtly, global inequalities today, our very perceptions of who is developed or prosperous. That's a powerful question. And maybe think about that omen we discussed, the Moroccan victory over Songhai thanks to guns. What other historical moments or even things happening now might look like omens in retrospect, foreshadowing big future shifts in power or technology that we don't fully recognize yet? Something to definitely mull over. Thank you for joining us on the deep dive.

You guys like my song? Have you ever heard that song before? Anybody? I don't think your audio is on. Yeah, we didn't hear anything. There was no music. Oh, crap. Well, let me try it again, because we need to hear that song. Was it the Sounds of Silence? Yeah. Simon and Garfunkel. My favorites. You know what I did? I forgot to turn the sound on for that window. All right. Can you hear it now? Throne the earth shall rise A new foundation we have been lost we shall be old Tis the final conflict Let he stand in his place the international Soviet shall be the human race is the mind of conflict Let me stand in his place we work through a condescending savior to rule us from a judgment hall we were to Satnam for their famous Let us consult for all to make the featless fortune to free the spirit from your cell we must ourselves decide our duty we must decide and do it well, Mr. Pilgrim then he stand in his place the International O yes, Jump in. A human race in the final conflict Let me stand in his place International so being. Tell me. Okay, now, did you like my song? Have you ever heard that song before? Anybody? No. No, I haven't heard that song, the International Soviet. Well, the name of the song is the International. And it is kind of like the national anthem of communism. But communism is not supposed to be national. It's actually international. And we'll talk more about that here in a few minutes. Right, but so when we say, instead of saying the national anthem, we should say the international anthem of communism. And does anybody want to guess why I played a song about communism today? Because we're going to talk about the Communist Manifesto. Very good. Actually, that's exactly right. We're going to talk about the Communist Manifesto. Which means that I want you to remember for the next 10 minutes or so a couple of lyrics from that song. The first one I want you to remember is them singing about the final conflict. We have to wonder, what is the final conflict? And then the other thing that I want you to remember is the international Soviet shall be the human race okay, so remember those two things. And I'll come back to them when we actually start talking about the Communist Manifesto. But before we do that, I have to talk about. Finish up talking about imperialism last Tuesday's lecture. All right, so any questions before I get started? Anything that I can help you with? I have to tell you, and I'm sad to say it, but I'm a bit disappointed in you guys because we have a discussion that's due at Midnight tonight and only three people have answered it. And if you're going to. I don't know how you can have any meaningful discussion if you wait to the last minute to post. Do you understand what I'm saying? And the whole purpose of this is for you guys to interact with each other. Does that make sense to you guys? Anybody have any comments or questions about that? Does it seem like I'm getting on your case? I am. Because you should have done this before you had a week to do this. Right. But here's what I'm going to do. Because I'm such a softy, I'm going to extend the discussion until Tuesday. But I want people to go in starting today and answer the discussion questions and interacting with each other. Okay. And then the next time I do the discussion, because we're going to do a couple more of these, I'm going to have to figure out a way to get you guys more prompt. All right, so any questions or comments about that? Everybody knows that that's something that you should do. You had plenty of time to do it. It's not like I, I, you know, limited you on the time. All right, any questions? Comments? Like I said, I'm not professor. I was trying to turn in the. The communist assignment, and it switched the time right as I pressed it and wouldn't let me turn it in. You shouldn't wait to the last minute. I know. I was just trying to turn it. You can turn in. You can turn in work late. Look at the announcements and see how you can turn work in late. Okay. All right. Any other questions? Okay, well, I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed. And because I know you guys can do better. All right, what we're going to do now is we're going to go back to finish up talking about industrialization. It was an enormous. It had an enormous impact on world history. Since then, we actually went from the feudal age into the manufacturing age. The manufacturing age was the age of most of American history up until about the middle of the 20th century. By now, we're actually. The United States is no longer a manufacturing country. Really. That's something we'll talk a little bit more about later. How it actually has. It has outsourced significance. It has significance on world history after World War II. And so when we talk about industrialization and we talk about communism, we want to keep in mind all the things we talked about, because that's going to inform our discussion of what happens after World War II or actually in the 20th century. All right. Questions. Comments about that. Okay, so now we'll remember that we went from an agrarian society to a manufacturing society. And we will remember that what we saw happen in that manufacturing society was a restructuring of society where you had, rather than lords and peasants, you had bourgeoisie who were the owners of the capital and the proletariat who were the workers. And the bourgeoisie owned the means of production, which was factories. And so because of that, they got the surplus from their labor, but it wasn't their labor. It was the labor of the proletarians, the workers. And the workers would work for a subsistence wage because they didn't have anything to trade for it, okay. Other than their labor. So they work for their labor, and there's plenty of labor available. So if you don't want to work for the wages that they give you, they'll find somebody else who will. All right? And that means you go without. All right? So. So that means then that now our entire national economy is centered on production. Okay? And when we talk about production, we talk about, for example, we talked about, you know, the. During the feudal age, that if you were going to make clothes for somebody, that would be done in a. In a. In a cottage with a peasant who owned a loom who would make things for you. But now we have. We have a. A factory making lots and lots of whatever article it is. We're going to talk about textiles, because that's the beginning of it. You're making lots and lots of textiles. What's a textile? Like a shirt. Right? Like T shirts. They're making lots and lots of T shirts. Right, okay. And these T shirts are made out of cotton. There's a problem, though, in England with making cotton T shirts, which is what. What do they not have in England that they need to make cotton T shirts? Cotton. Cotton. Is it cotton? Cotton? Exactly. You can't grow cotton in England because cotton is a tropical crop. So I'm sorry, they. So they had, like, wool, right? They were using. They had animal. Right. They had wool, but they. They didn't have enough wool to. To manufacture textiles at the rate that they eventually did. Right. Because one of the things you need to keep in mind about capitalism is that the. The output of the production has to continuously grow, right. In order for capitalism to be what they call healthy. Right. So at any rate, the point here is that you have to get cotton from somewhere. So they need resources, and it's everything else that they need, too. They don't really have everything that they need, and they have to get that from somewhere else, right? So now if it was you or me, and we decided we wanted to make a cotton factory, the first thing we do is we put everything together and then we figure out where can we get some cotton. And we would make deals with the people who were producing the cotton so that we could get the cotton and sell it at a profit, a reasonable profit. But what the Europeans did because of the Industrial revolution and because part of that industrial revolution was to make the European powers much more powerful militarily than other countries, right? Other countries that had been at one point unassailable had been invincible, like China, now all of a sudden find themselves weak in the face of European powers. And we're talking now in the beginning with England, we're talking about India. They get their continent first from the United States, and then after the civil war, they're not able to get it there anymore. Or. Well, they don't. They don't need to get it there anymore. And they get it from other places like Egypt and particularly India, right? So. So what happens is then they go into India and they'll say, okay, you have cotton and we have guns, and if you give us your cotton, we won't kill you. Right? And so what that does then is it leads to the control of the resources of other countries for the benefit of the industrial country. We see England controlling the resources of India for the benefit of British industry. We see France controlling West Africa and Southeast Asia and its resources for the benefit of French industry. You guys get what I'm saying? So. So that is the motive then behind imperialism, right? The whole purpose of having an empire is to provide for the economy of the. What I'm going to call the metropolis. Okay, we'll talk more about that on a different day. But it's the center, the country, that has the military power, that has the industrial economy and generally also has a liberal government. Okay, you guys follow me here. Okay, so imperial. So manufacturing industry actually leads to imperialism because of the need for markets. Okay. It's not just markets, though. I mean, Excuse me, resources. It's not just resources, though. You need markets. So, for example, in England, if you're making hundreds of thousands of sweaters, you don't have enough population to have those sweaters make you any money. So what are you going to do with those sweaters? You have to sell them somewhere. And if you have an empire that's full of people like India or places in China or other places in Asia, you can sell your finished goods to them. So what ends up Happening then is that you, you. You control the resources of another country to make goods that you sell back to that country. Okay, now that's not always the case with imperialism. We'll see how sometimes markets are not that. Are not that big of a deal, but resources are always something that. That motivates imperialism. Okay, so imperialism, just remember, the definition of imperialism is control of one. One country's control of another country's resources for the benefit of the first country's economy. Okay, what is the definition of imperialism? The control of another country's resources to benefit your economy. Exactly. So. So, Alec B. What is the definition of imperialism? A refresher on that one, Professor. Sorry, see, that's the point that I'm trying to make here. You guys are not listening to me because I just now said it right. I just now said it right. Tell them. What it is, Aaron, is the control of another country's resources for the benefit of your economy. So, so, Alec, what is. What is the definition of imperialism? It is the control of other resources for your own economy. Exactly. All right, and now what about Patricia? Patricia, what is the definition of imperial? Am I to understand that Patricia is not listening at all? How about, let's see. Let's see your show of hands? So I guess Patricia didn't put her hand up, Is that right? No, I put my hand up. Are you saying something to me? Yes, I was. I was asking you what is the definition of imperialism? You can ask. You guys can all put your hands down. Now, what is the definition of imperialism? I'm not sure. Well, see, that's a real problem because I just had. I just said what the definition was and I just had two other students repeat what the definition was. Do you see how this could be a problem, how you might have difficulty learning. Learning things? Okay, so who was it that I asked? Who's the second person I asked? Alec, Alec, Alec, tell Patricia. What is, what is the definition of imperialism? It is the control of other resources to benefit the group in power. It. There's a. There's a better way to explain it, but. Well, that, that was. That's. That's good enough. It's the control one country's control of another country's resources for the benefit of the first country's economy. Industrial economy. All right, so. So, Patricia, what is the definition of imperialism? The definition of imperialism is one country having control resources over another to benefit their own country. Exactly. See you guys are you guys. All you got to do is pay attention and you'll get this stuff all Right. So let's move on. Don't want to spend a lot of time on that. The thing, though, that happens is. And I think that you guys got a picture of this when you watch the movie the Color of Money, which was that race becomes an issue in imperialism because the industrialized powers, we call them modernized countries, are all European at the beginning. Right? And so that means that the areas of the world that are being controlled by the Europeans are not white, generally speaking. And because Europeans are so powerful technologically and militarily, they tend to think of people in other places as somehow less capable or less human than they are. Okay, so there's this sense then that Europeans. Well, let's think about it this way, that there's a. There's a progress, okay? That. Well, we talked about. Progress means that we're always moving forward. Right? And that. And the idea, the European idea is that. Or I should say the liberal idea of this, the Enlightenment idea, is that the progress. Every country, every group of people is moving forward toward this progress, whatever it is, but not at the same rate. And so what ends up happening then is the Europeans believe that they are ahead of everybody else in terms of progress. And essentially what that means is that they define themselves as superior to everybody else based on their scientific achievement. Essentially. Right? So what ends up happening then is we end up with something that you guys have all heard of, real recently, called white supremacy. White people must be supreme over other races, which is defined by skin color, because they're much more advanced. And this leads to two different relationships, both of them racist, but one of them, the English way, is going to say, well, because we have advanced ahead of other countries, ahead of other races, we need to help these other races to become civilized, like us. So that's the Big Brother idea. And you guys may or may not have heard of the poem that was written by Rudyard Kipling when he was trying to encourage Americans to take on an empire. He wrote a poem called the Great White Burden. And what that meant was that it was the burden of white people to carry these less civilized people into progress. You guys follow me here. That's one aspect. The other aspect, the other response essentially, is, well, because they're superior, we can take whatever we want. Because they're inferior, we can take from them whatever we want. Right? So we can see the English and the French. Isn't that what the beginning of the Color of Money was talking about, when it came to the English perspective of it, was that they were. They needed to find a justification for the labor that they needed in the New World and the justification of being able to work these people to death or, you know, work them in inhumane conditions. So it was not necessarily that they were bringing the other definition, which was like, oh, we're going to help the Africans become civilized like us. They wanted to justify not doing that and just forcing them to be the workforce. Well, that's. That's that the first. I'm sorry, I'm kind of stumbling here. What you said about basically just using them and looking for a justification for using them, that was the beginning of colonialism. Right. So that's the way the Spanish acted and also the English and other European countries that colonized the Americas. But it was always accompanied by the idea that we're going to make them better. Right. So even when the Spanish came to America, they subjugated the native populations, but they justified it by saying, well, we're making them Christians, so they're no longer pagans and they can go to heaven. Right. And so that's this idea of we're bringing this superior way of life to you, and as a result of that, you should pay for it by providing labor for us. Does that answer your question? Yeah, but that. My thing was that they didn't do that. They didn't do that with the blacks. There was. There was no push in the Americas from the English to civilize or civilize the Africans. They were just straight up using them. And, well, they didn't want to civilize the natives either. It was just a matter of convincing themselves that they were helping them. There's even people. Yeah, but there's even people today who will say that slavery was actually good for Africa because it brought people to America to learn how to be good. Liberals, essentially. Right. And that was what people convinced themselves of at the time. They would say, especially time during the Industrial Revolution we're talking about now, they would say, well, yeah, we have the slaves, but they get to live in their own houses and they get to, you know, cultivate their own food and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And. And people who work in factories don't get that. They don't have that same kind of freedom that slaves have. So slaves actually a positive good. That's an argument that they made. Right. So there's always this idea that. That our domination of this other group is for their benefit. Does that make sense? Yeah, but I get what you're saying. Where. The second part that I was actually discussing has to do with like, Germany. Right. So Germany during World War II, decided that the people who lived in Eastern Europe were not human. And because of that, they could take whatever they wanted. And so they moved into the Ukraine. That was their kind of goal, was to move into the Ukraine and they wiped out anybody that was in their way. They were going to get rid of all those people so that they could occupy that land because they were the superior race. And we saw Japan do the same thing during World War II or during the 1930s. Japan, which became an industrial power, moves into Korea, moves into China, and basically tries to replace them with themselves, to take all their resources and use them only for their own benefit. So there wasn't any sense that the Japanese were going to move in and make everybody good Japanese people. Right. Or good Japanese imperialists or anything like that. You follow what I'm saying? Yeah. What's funny is they're always. There's always these small little nations trying to, like, expand out. Like, you know, like, Japan is not that big, so it needs. It wanted to take over China, which is much bigger, and Korea connected. And the same thing with, like, England is a small place, their imperial giant, but the actual. Right, but now think about what I think about the definition of imperialism that I gave you. And why would a small country like Japan or England want to expand into a bigger country? Well, exactly. They don't have resources anymore. They don't have the resources. Exactly. Why do you think that the United States was. By the time we get to the beginning of the 20th century, the United States is the most advanced, most powerful, most powerful industrial country on earth. But the United States doesn't have a huge empire like the British. Why? Because we have all the resources. Because we already have all those resources. You follow what I'm saying? So that means that, I mean, the United States does become an imperial power, but not like British or the French or any other country, because we have the resources we need already right here in the United States. Right. That makes sense. Yeah. Okay. All right. So at any rate, the point here that I'm trying to make is there's this sense of white supremacy that accompanies imperialism, which is. It's expressed in terms like the British use the civilizing mission. Right. We're actually in India to extract resources from India, but we tell ourselves that we are there to civilize the Indians. Right. Well, what's wrong with that? Well, the one problem with that is that the Indians were highly advanced and highly civilized while the people in the British Isles were running around in the woods naked, blue, painting themselves blue. Right. So the idea that European civilization is more advanced than any other civilization is a construction. It's not real. The reality is that what was the major advantage that the Europeans had over every other country was their military power. Does that make sense, you guys? Questions? Comments about that? Okay, so. And so what I wanted to point out to you here is, like, during the 19th century. We can think of the 19th century as the age of imperialism. And we see England and France dividing up the world between themselves. Right? And then here we have the United States practicing its imperialism in the Americas, which we'll talk more about on a different day. Right. And then here is Japan. All right, well, let's think about this for a second. Wait a minute. Japan's not Western, is it? What do we mean when we say Western? It's adopted the Western culture, though, at this time. Exactly. So they actually remember we. I think I have a picture here. I showed you guys about how the Japanese thought that the only way to actually modernize was to adopt Western ways. Right? And they did. They were very successful at it. The problem is that when that. What that. What that does is it leads to Japan becoming an imperial power, which will eventually lead to. Anybody want to guess? World War II imperialism. Exactly. World War II. All right, okay. So I'm kind of done with that. Any questions about industrialization? I'm sorry. I had to do it in two different days because it makes it harder to understand, I think. Anyway, questions, Comments about anything. All right, let me start a different one now, then. Oh, let me just go here. All right, so it's a great background, by the way. Talk a little bit. That's the Communist Party. Looks like a. Like an album. Like a. There you go. It's a really famous picture. I've seen it many times. But I really like it in terms of keeping it light about Communism because everybody's so freaked out about Communism, even though almost nobody knows what it is. Right. And again, I want to make sure you guys know I am not a communist. I can tell you exactly why Communism cannot work. The government's not listening to you right now. Don't worry about it. You don't have to keep repeating that. Oh, you don't know about that. I mean, they put that microchip in my vaccine, so they know everything I'm doing right now. All right, anyway, so a couple things I wanted to talk about before we go in and talk about the book, actually. Let me ask you guys first. What did you guys think? It was a pretty easy read, right? Yeah, it was actually really easy. Do you think that you picked up what was the big. Was the big idea. You think you got a pretty good handle on what the document was trying to say? Yeah, I mean, very repetitive, I realize. And. Yeah, class struggle. Well, class struggle, Right, exactly. Let's. Let's put that in perspective, though, because I don't think that. I know that the manifesto itself doesn't actually. It tells you that the history of the world is basically manifested by class struggle, struggle between classes, but it doesn't tell you what the kind of ideology behind that is, Right? So. So in order for us to understand that, we have to go to one of the. One of the later Enlightenment figures, the German Enlightenment figures, named George Hegel, Right? I didn't get a chance to finish all this. I was still working on it 10 minutes before class, right? But if I. If I was going to do it, I would put a picture of George Hegel, right? And I would tell you that he was a German philosopher and that he came up with an idea called the dialectic. He also, if you want to know, whether you want to know or not, he actually, one of his famous quotes was, we learn nothing from history. We. The only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history. So at any rate, he was actually Marx's mentor, Karl Marx's mentor, and he came up with this dialectic. And the dialectic. One of the things about this era is you will recall that everything is supposed to be scientific. We're moving away from revelation and faith and mystical things, and we're trying to make everything scientific. And there was a movement by many people to try to make the behavior of society scientific or to explain it in a scientific way, right? So Hegel came up with a kind of a formula for the advance of human ideology, I guess you could say, right? And this idea was that in every historical age there is a dominant idea or a thesis. We'll call it a thesis because that's what he called it, Right? This dominant idea is this. This thesis is the dominant idea of a historical age, right? So we call it the spirit of the age, Right. When we talk about the spirit of the age, what does it mean? It means that this is our. Our. Our idea, all right? This is our kind of ideological understanding of ourselves. Okay? What happens is that a. What develops over time in a historical age is something that opposes the thesis. So we're going to call it the antithesis, right? And the antithesis basically contradicts or goes into conflict with the thesis and the outcome of this conflict between the Antithesis. And the thesis is not going to be one dominating the other. It's going to be a new thesis which we call a synthesis. Right? So, so parts of the antithesis and part of the thesis form the new thesis or the new synthesis. Right? But, but here's what happens is that what Hegel, what Hegel theorized was that this synthesis would then become the thesis of the new age, of the next historical age. Right? And then you would go through the same process, right? And that's how human intellect advances over time. The, the end. This has an end. It's not something that goes on forever. Eventually what will happen will be that there will be a conflict that results in a synthesis that no antithesis arise, arises to oppose. Does that make sense to you guys? So, so what that means then is that this will be when humankind achieves its ultimate fulfillment. So, so the dialectic then says that through this process of conflict between ideas, we will end up eventually with human fulfillment. Okay, you guys follow me here. Questions, comments about this. Well, now as I mentioned, Marx was a. Hegel was Marx's mentor, or Marx was a student of Hegel. But Marx broke with Hegel by saying that, well, these, this dialectic isn't the interplay between intellect or spirit. This dialectic is the interplay between classes. Right? So when he says that class conflict is the basis for world history, he's talking about the conflict between two different classes in any historical age, which leads to a new historical age. And eventually what will happen according to Marx, right? By the way, because this is scientific, this is actually a formula that you can explain history with, right? That means you can predict the future. Okay, so, so what Marx is saying is that this is all scientific. And if you, at some point or another, you may hear the term scientific Marxism. Well, that's what he means. It means that it's going to inevitably end up with this classless society. Right? Okay, so, so basically then, in fact, let me just show you how this works. If you, if you think about the way Marx imagines the world, right? Marx says, okay, we started with the feudal class, which I talked about at the beginning of last, the last lecture, right? And in the future, in the feudal class, he had lords and peasants, right? And you would say, okay, okay, wait a minute. Then that must mean that there's two classes that are in conflict, but it's not, okay? The class that comes in conflict with the, with the lords is what, what class? You guys remember what broke up the feudal system? The mercantile class, right? The merchants, the People from the Bourg, Burg, Bourges, right, Or the burghs. The bourgeoisie, right? So the lords go into conflict with the bourgeoisie. See how this works here? Boom. See? And we end up in a new historical age, right? In the modern age. And this is the age that Marx is writing in. Okay? And now in the new historical age, we have two new classes, right? The newest class though is the proletariat. We see how the proletariat becomes a new class that is a growing class, right? But, but because of the nature of capitalism, the proletariat is prone to revolution. And according to Marx, this revolution is inevitable, right? So then when we see that the new antithesis clash with the new thesis, we have another conflict and then we end up with this new socialist society, right? But now what's interesting here is that according to Marx, there isn't going to be any antithesis in the new society. It will be a classless society where everybody controls everything equally in common, everybody is equal and there's no need for a government. It's pure democracy. Right? And so what, what Marx says is that this is inevitable. Now how can we explain why Marx says this is inevitable? Why does Marx think this is inevitable? Because the bourgeoisie provide the infrastructure of their own demise, right? They, they create their own gravediggers, right? And so there's going to be this revolution and this revolution is going to end up with this new socialist society after the ten point plan, right? But why is it inevitable? What makes it inevitable? Why do you think it's capitalism? Because capitalism's ever, ever is trying to progress and like forever, eventually it's going to run out. You can't. Right? It can't just go on forever in progress. Okay, well that's, that's one way of thinking about it. But I'm, I'm trying to get you to understand or to think about why. Basically the basis of Marx's argument here, why he thinks he can explain history in this fashion and boldly proclaim that this is going to be the outcome. Why does he think that it's because the growth in the lower class, the working class, is higher so that there's more workers and the production and the, the use of technology advancing has made it so that there's more workers and more positions, and then comes the unions, and then the unions will take down the capitalists. Well, that's almost right. You were right all the way up until they started talking about unions. But no, I mean, you guys got that. But that's not exactly what I'm thinking about here when I talk about the dialectic. What is the dialectic? It's a. It's the scientific formula. He's saying that that'll break up the, the. The thesis and antithesis back and forth because there will be no class. Right, exactly. And. And that's exactly what Hegel said too. Except Hegel thought that it would be some kind of a spiritual or ideological fulfillment of mankind. What, what Marx says is that it will be an economic fulfillment. And that's where they come up with the term economic determinism. Everything is determined by economics. Right. You guys follow what I'm saying here? All right, so the reason why he proclaimed essentially that this is the. That this is the age that we live in now and this is the age where we're going. Right. He says he can be. He can be certain about that prediction because it's a scientific formula. Just like if you guys remember, we talked about Galileo's law, right? Galileo's law is that objects in motion accelerate at 32ft per second per second. Right. And because we know that we can predict any object in motion. Right. So what Marx is saying is that this communism, this communist ideology, the dialectic is just as scientific as that. What do you guys think? Does that sound right? Do you think the dialectic is actually scientific? No. Let me kind of help you along with this a little bit. This is one of the questions that I asked you. When is this revolution supposed to happen, according to Marx? A long time ago, I think. Right, right. Exactly. When he wrote it was in 1848 when he wrote. Right. And he. So the revolution is supposed to happen now. And. And where is it supposed to happen? Everywhere. Everywhere. Everywhere, Exactly. So the revolution is supposed to happen now and it's supposed to happen everywhere. When did it actually happen? It didn't. It's ongoing. Never. So. And so where did it actually happen? Nowhere. Right. I mean, it started in Russia, though. Right. Well, that was. That. But that wasn't. That wasn't according to Marxist theory. We'll talk more about that on a different day. Right. But they didn't have this. This conflict of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat that creates the Russian Revolution. That was a different thing altogether. Right. Because Russia was an industrialized country, it was an agricultural country. But anyway, the point here is that this revolution is supposed to happen now and it's supposed to happen everywhere, but it actually happens nowhere and never. So that tells me that this, this thesis, this. This formula that Marx is using is probably not scientific. Right. You see what I'm saying? So the question then, I mean. All right, we'll leave it at that for now. We'll come back to it later. All right. Questions or comments about any of that. Does that help you understand Marx's argument a little better? Yeah, that helps. It's interesting that, like, people he was. He conceived of, like, the end or the end of that, like class struggle and stuff like that. But it's like he didn't understand human nature, that there's always going to be some kind of conflict. He really thought that there would be an end to conflict. Well, he. Yeah, he did, actually. And he also. He also thought that. What he also didn't understand was that the conditions in industrial Europe in 1848 were not present everywhere else in the world. So what that means is that he thinks that this formula that derives from the experience of 1848 Europe will fit everywhere in the world. Right. And it doesn't, because the structures of different societies are very different. Okay, so. So even if they had been able to pull off the communist revolution in Europe, it wouldn't have been an international revolution because the proletariat didn't exist everywhere. Yeah. Do you follow what I'm saying here? Yeah. You can't go to Maori island and make that happen. Exactly. But you know what's real? One of the things that if you ever. If you continue to study history. Right. One of the things that you'll find is that there are a number of scholars who believe so much in the. In the communist dialectic that they will try to explain the history of other countries in terms of the dialectic. And what they end up with is bad history. Because, I mean, economics is very important in any history, but it's not. You can't fit it into a mold. Every history is different. Right. Every history has to be taken on its own terms, not according to a theory. Does that make sense? Okay, well, anyway, let's go through these questions. Hopefully we can go through them rather quickly. What is the significance of class struggle? You guys all answered these questions, right? It's like we just talked about it. Really. What is this? It's a cycle of opposition, opposing classes. And the communist is what. Okay. Communism is how they. It will end where it'll stop that cycle. Yeah. Right. Basically, then in terms. Go ahead. Marxism basically, is saying that class struggle could define essentially all of history and the current advancement. And that final step will be. Right. Almost an enlightenment, which is communism, of the end of class struggle and the elimination of Class. Right. So class struggle. Class struggle is what moves history toward this ultimate end. Right. Class struggle is what moves history. Does that make sense? I think that's a good answer. All right, so now in this new era, we're living in 1848 now. Right. In this new era, who are the two classes? The bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Proletariats. Yep. Exactly. Okay. The bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Where do the bourgeoisie come from? They come from the serfs and the feudal. Yeah, feudal serfs, which are then the burgages or. I'm talking about the bourgeoisie now. Right. Is. Comes from the. The end of the. The feudal or end of feudalism. The middle age. Right, but who are the bourgeoisie? Are they the mercantile merchants? The ruling class? Right, they're the merchant classes. The merchant classes. Right. Okay. And then they came from. How did they become a ruling class? How did they get the ability to take over from the lords all the capital they had. Question. So all the capital they had. Right. Discovery of America. So the discovery of America. Remember we talked about how the discovery of America actually fuels the industrial revolution? Right. Because of the. The amount of wealth that's extracted from America. Right. But the wealth is extracted by these people that lived in the cities who were not part of the three. The. The ancient order. Right. The burghers or the bourgeoisie. Right. So they're the ones that are making money from America. And in the other class, who's the other class is a proletariat. Where do they come from? Well, they were people who came from rural areas into towns to find work. No, exactly. Right, exactly. So what is the difference between a peasant and a proletarian? A peasant used to be able to toil in their own land, and now they have to go into either the factories or somebody else's place to give their labor and make money from them instead of being able to make money off of what they work on specifically. Okay, so. So what did the peasants own that the proletarians don't own? Their own Labor, Means of production. So remember the loom? We talked about the loom? Yeah, the means of production. Right. So the peasants owned the means of production, and because of that they got their surplus. But now in this industrial age, a peasant can't own a factory. And so the proletarian who goes and applies for work, the only thing he has to trade for it is labor. His labor. Labor, Exactly. Right. Okay. According to the document, what is the purpose of then existing governments who work in the interest of the bourgeoisie. Exactly. So they're there to enforce the rights of the bourgeoisie, who we could also call the property owners. Does that sound like a familiar idea? That the purpose of government is to protect the property owners? Yeah. Yes, it sounds pretty familiar. Yeah, that. Where did we get that idea from originally? We actually read. Right, from Locke. Exactly. That's what. Exactly what Locke says. Right. So. So the communist idea isn't actually. It's not exaggerating anything when it says that the purpose of government is to. Is to enforce the rights of the bourgeoisie or the property owners. Right. Am I right about this? Questions? Comments? Okay, now how does the document describe the relationship between classes in the current era? Well, they're in conflict with each other. But what's really important though is that because the bourgeoisie owns the means of production and the proletarians own only their labor, how could you say, what would you say is the relationship between the bourgeoisie and the proletarian unbalanced Would be a state of war on. It's. It's unbalanced. Okay. And, and that's. You're right about that. Let's think about what would we call it if somebody had the ability to control what somebody else is doing? Slave and an owner. Well, it's not necessarily slavery, but we would call it oppression. Right. We would say. Or exploitation. Right. That the bourgeoisie is taking advantage of the disadvantages of the proletarians. Right. So remember when we talked about how Adam Smith said that everybody could attain as much wealth as they wanted depending on if you allowed them to pursue their own enlightened self interest? Right. But now Marxists say he's agreeing with that. But he's not calling it enlightened self interest. He's calling it what? Exploitive? Naked self interest. Yeah. So naked self interest is exploitative. I don't care about what happens to you as long as I get the money. Right. So if you get worked to death and I get the money, I don't care. Right. Now this is not new. Okay? It's not something that's new in capitalism. But what the problem then? And I think that we come to the answer to this in question number six, we say relate these two statements from the document. The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production and thereby the relations of production and with them, the whole relations of society. What does that mean? You guys have already said it. So you guys know this, right? What is he saying here? What is the nature of capitalism? That's progress. It's Constant progress. It has to always grow, Right? Okay. It always has to grow. And so the second phrase or the second statement. But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself, it has also called into existence the men who are to wield these weapons. The modern working class, the proletarians. Right, so now how do those two statements relate? They're actually on two different pages. Right? How do they relate? How does the fact that capitalism, in order to be healthy has to continue to grow lead to the. The conclusion that the bourgeoisie is creating its own gravediggers? Because it's, it's constant growth is going to constantly exploit the worker. The worker will eventually. And there will be more and more workers and less and less, which I think somebody said at the beginning of this. But there'll be less and less of the bourgeoisie and way more workers. And eventually they will come together and rise against. Yeah, it's kind of like the idea of what happened in the Haitian Revolution. Eventually there were 40,000 white people and 500,000 black people and they couldn't withstand it. Right. It's the same thing here. This is the idea. The idea is that if the proletariat has to continue to grow, then eventually they will be more powerful than the state that is guaranteeing or supporting the rights of the bourgeoisie. Does that make sense to you guys? And then once they become more powerful than the state, then what happens? Revolution. Revolution. This revolution. Right. So the document says what the bourgeoisie therefore produces above all or its own gravediggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable. Now again, why is it inevitable? Because they need to keep going, they need to keep advancing. Right. But in a shorter answer, the Marx is actually working. I can't find my book right now. Marx is actually working on. According his, his, his theory here is being laid out. According to what? What's the basis for his theory? Dialectic. That's what we started talking about, just Hegelian dialectic. Dialectic. Right. And what is it? And what is the dialectic is an equation. It is science equation. It's scientific formula. Right. And so because it's scientific, what does that mean? That means that the outcome is, if you apply the formula, what will happen. It's inevitable. Right? Yes. Right. Okay, so now here in my book. I don't know if you guys have the same book that I have. Right. I hate when this happens. Anyway, this is the little book I've got, right. Page 23, Mark says, the theory of Communism may be summed up in one single sentence. What is it that. Abolition of private property. So exactly. Abolition of private property. Did somebody have a question with the whole science? Let me ask you this. It was built on a like, scientific formula. If it was science, wouldn't it be like you'd make a hypothesis and then you do your test the formula, see what your result is, and then after you produce something, then you try again to try to produce whatever you're trying to produce. So if it's in that form, then when his specific equation not necessarily fail, but his hypothesis fail, but it could always be added upon or subtracted. Yeah, you're right. Except that he thinks that that hypothesis has already been proven by his historical analysis. So he's saying. Remember he talked about the analysis of how you move from one age to another. He, he says this proves the. The hypothesis. Right. Okay, but now wait a minute. What does property have to do with what we're talking about here? Oh, it's the. It won't exist anymore. Right, but why is property the problem? Why do we need to abolish property as property gives? Remember Locke said the whole purpose of things was property? Right. What property really are we talking about here? It's the capital of the bourgeoisie, the means of production. Right, the capital of the bourgeoisie. What sets the bourgeoisie apart from the proletarians? What do they own? Property. Property, means of production, capital. Own which property? The means of production. Exactly. They own the means of production. Right. Because they own the means of production. That's what creates this. This inequality. Right. So Marx's solution then is that we're going to take away the property of the bourgeoisie and everybody hold it in common. Right. Instead of the bourgeoisie owning the property and the proletarians only owning their labor, we'll only have one class of people who all own the property and all share in the product, the surplus. Okay, do you guys get that? Does anybody remember how that's supposed to happen? I mean, it starts with the revolution, but how is. Does the revolution end with the proletariat? They become the ruling class. Right, but how do that, how does that happen? What is that the revolution actually is rid of private property so that it's all publicly owned, so that the workers are the ones in charge of what they get to do and what they get to. Political supremacy. They attain political supremacy. It's right. Everything is governed by the state. Exactly. So think about this now. Well, in the beginning, right, that's what I'm trying to get you Guys, to realize here is the ten point plan, right? The ten point plan, what does it do? It takes the property away from the bourgeoisie and then it gives it to everybody else, right? It shares everything in common. And once everything is shared in common and there is no longer any private property, what does the government do appears at the end of the 10 point plans, it disappears. There is no government. There's no need for government because everybody's happy, everybody's getting what they want. You guys follow what I'm saying, okay? Now when we think about that, when we say, okay, we're going to take away private property and everybody's going to own everything in common, which means essentially that we're sharing everything, right? If that's true, does that sound like something that we would like? No, let me say, let me say, okay, you have a car and I don't have a car, so I think you should share your car with me. Right? But I have a car and you don't have a car. I think, I think you should get your own car. You see what I'm saying? So I don't mind sharing things if I don't have anything, but I don't want to share things that I have. Right? You guys get what I'm saying? So what that means then is that some people will argue that that's human nature, right? Human nature is we don't want to share things in common. We want to own things and control things on our own. Right? And Americans totally believe this. I, I, I believe. Right, okay. So in general, I would say that's true. Okay, so, so the answer to that, according to Marx, because he anticipates this, he says, you know, we say, well, communism's against, it's against human nature because as Aaron already mentioned, there's always going to be conflict and there's always going to be people that want to be, get one up on somebody else. Right? And nobody wants to be equal with everybody else. Right? Okay. Unless you're not equal. Okay. All right. So, so now Marx answers this by saying, does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man's ideas, views and conceptions, in a word, man's consciousness change with every change in the conditions of his material existence, in his social relations and in his social life. What does that mean, human nature? Well, what you can go, oh, sorry, somebody. Okay, so what I wrote, Go ahead, go ahead, please. Okay, okay, okay, so what I know what I wrote was that that pretty much what he meant by that was that everybody is shaped by their experience and what they are taught, you know, like. Kind of like what John Locke said in his. Right. Essay. Exactly, exactly. So. So you guys remember when I talk. And there's the hint, right. There's the key. Right. Remember I talked about the tabula rasa and how Locke says human beings become who they are? What did he say? He said that everybody's born as a blank slate and that they become who they are by sensory experiences which are written on this slate. Right. Okay. So what Marx is doing here is he's agreeing with Locke. He's saying, well, the reason why people are greedy and acquisitive and lazy is because that's the conditions that they've grown up in. But if we change those conditions, then people will no longer be greedy, lazy, and acquisitive. Right. You follow what I'm saying? He's agreeing with Marx. What do you think about that? I put down. Keep in mind that the Enlightenment project, no matter what, though, like, you know, you can end up being born somewhere in that country where you're on a mountain and it rains all the time and these people live over here and it doesn't. Or you could be born with one leg shorter than the other. Like, there's. There's things that you can't make everything equal. And we're not exactly, you know, a blank slate. Right. But we can. Okay, go ahead. We're not a blank slate. Okay. That's true, I think, to a certain extent. But remember that the Enlightenment project has always been fueled by the idea of education. Right. That if we educate the people in certain ideas, we will create these kinds of people. Right. So this is. This is not something that's new. Marx is actually agreeing with that, but he's saying that the education be. Should be toward everybody sharing everything instead of. Instead of everybody being in competition with each other. Right. Does that make sense to you guys? That's real. Do you think? It is real? Just. I'm sorry. Isn't that indoctrination? I'm sorry, Esteban, I didn't. Yeah. Isn't that indoctrination? Yeah, I mean, we're. We're. I'm indoctrinating you right now. I'm. It is indoctrination. Absolutely. I'm indoctrinating you right now. Right? Yeah, but. Trying to get you to think for yourselves. Right? To think for ourselves. But in their. In their light, they're trying to make people think in. In only in one way only and only in a certain way, like, to share. But isn't he saying he's saying that you will be born into that society. So they don't even have to do it. It's like, hey look you, this is just how society works so you don't have to indoctrinate it. One of the things that, okay, so one of the things that we notice from history is that every country that's tried to institute communism has gone through a process of rehashing. Right. Trying to re educate everybody into this new way of thinking. Right. You follow what I'm saying? What Esteban is saying about indoctrination is absolutely right. But think about this. When you were going to school as elementary school and middle school and high school, they were teaching you that the best way to live is according to democracy and secularism and capitalism. Right. And all of the things that go along with that. So that's indoctrination, isn't it? Right. So when communists indoctrinate people in different values, it's not any different from the Dr. Doctrination that we're receiving now. Does that make sense to you, Esteban? Well, from, from the communist indoctrination, that perspective is the only one that you see and that's the only one that's presented. I don't think there's like they're, they're presenting opposing views to that doctrine that they're trying to, to instill in the people. Yes, but in the American school system most of us don't really learn about communism and then we just say it's bad. And that's just how we've been indoctrinated. You can go to a like religious school and the creation of man through that perspective and that's indoctrination because of that. So it just depends on where you grew up and what you want to believe. I don't know. Isn't the difference though that, that what, what professor is saying is that in all these communist societies they were something else. Then communism happens and they have to re educate. Whereas we're already born in the United States and we're under the education that has been part of the United States. It's not like a different, it's not like capitalism just took over the United States and now they're re educating us on how to do capitalism. Communism has had to take over and then re educate and then it just hasn't worked out. But through, I would say it's the same through like a. Okay, so sense that we'd have to re educate through a democratic like standard instead of being in a monarchy like we used to Be. It's the same type of re education. That's what. If you think about part of, part of our, if you think about part of our nation building efforts in other parts of the world are, you know, we have to educate people on how to be good Democrats. Right? They don't know how to be Democrats. They've never been Democrats. Just like the reform. The thing about it is, and where I understand what you're saying, Esteban, is that when we look at something in a certain way, we just think, well, that's just the way it is because that's the way we've been taught or that's the way we've grown up. So what is that? That's ontological to us, right? And anything that looks different we'll say, well, yeah, there's this different way of looking at things and here's why it's wrong. Do you see what I'm saying? Okay, it's not so. It's not that we, it's not that we, we don't know about other things. It's just that we look at them as automatically being wrong because of whatever. Right. Does that make sense? I'm not saying that communism is right. I'm just saying that indoctrination is going to happen no matter what. Right? Okay, so let's, let's. Hopefully we can finish this right now. How does a document describe how proletariat rise? That's the, the, the word I'm looking for. That's the revolution. The, the revolution of the proletariat. And then when and where was this supposed to happen? It was supposed to happen now and everywhere. When and where did it actually happen? Nowhere. Right. So that is kind of a problem with, with Marxist dialectic, isn't it? Right? He's saying that this is going to be inevitable and it's not inevitable. But you know what's interesting is that since then there have been volumes and volumes and volumes of work written trying to explain how Marx is right even though he was wrong. Right? So if you ex, if you insist that something is true even though you can't prove it, what do you call that? Do you call that reason or do you call that faith? Faith. It's faith. Right. So communism isn't. If you believe that communism is inevitable, that's a faith proposition. There's no evidence to show you that it will, that it is inevitable. Right. Doesn't mean it's wrong, but it does mean that there's no scientific basis for it. Okay, you get what I'm saying? All right. We talked about the kind of government and in. So I think I'm going to leave it right there. I just want to know what you guys think about this, this experience of learning about what's in the Communist Manifesto. Did you learn anything? Yes. What if we say no? Does it give you a different perspective on the world? I'm sorry, I was making a bad joke. Does it give you a different perspective? I didn't understand it. I didn't hear you. That's. I'm too busy talking. You know, I'm. I'm a talker. So I think it's really interesting to look at thing that's not traditionally looked at in a democratic society. Do you think that we should be able to look at communism as an idea without being accused of being communist? Yeah, of course. Otherwise, I mean, I'm sure we'll learn about this later. Otherwise, you should be able to study like, you know, all types of topics or whatever without being someone who, you know, aligns with that view. Right, right. So I can read. I can read the Communist Manifesto and understand it without being a communist. Right. I can actually, I can take. Actually, because I'm pretty well educated, I can actually tell you exactly why communism doesn't work. Right. Think. It's like you were asking to learn it. You should. The only, like, the only good argument against, like, bad speech or bad ideas is good ideas. And, and you need to understand why something's a bad idea to even be able to say or to proclaim to other people why it's a bad idea. You can't just. Well, I was told. Yeah, I, I have to tell you, I think that you guys who are in this class, you people who are in this class right now probably know way more about communism, having just read a little bit that you did than probably 70 to 80% of Americans, because most Americans have no idea what communism is. And so somebody can come along and say, oh, that's communist. And they'll say, oh, it's bad. They don't even know what it is. Right. I think it's also because of all the. Okay. And that's why education is. Because most of them come. Right. Well, here's the other thing. I mean, what we, what we saw. What we saw Marx describe is not. Has never been implemented anywhere. So when other places call themselves communist, could we say that they're really communists? It's never truly existed anywhere. Right. So we have to be able to differentiate between theory and practice. Keep in mind that the United States calls itself a democracy. Right. North Korea also calls itself a democracy. Are they the same? Are they the same kind of government? But even the US Isn't a true democracy. No. So the. The word, you know, it's a republic, but the point is that it's. The word has to. You have to use the definition of the word, right? You have to use it in context. Let me do this before I. I have to get. Let you guys go. And I want to call the rules. So I want to go ahead and go through the role here. Right now, everybody listen up. Right? And answer when I call your name. Sammy Aguilar. Sammy Aguilar. Yes. Here. Vanessa Alvarez. Oh, you're here. Okay, let me. I don't want you guys to see this. Okay. Vanessa Alvarez. Vanessa. Vanessa's not here. Alec Bennett. Here. He was here. Yeah, he's here. There's a lag. There you go. There's a lag. Professor Austin. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. There's an audio lag. Austin. Austin. Austin Bjorgam. Seamus. Here. Claire. Here. Good. Aaron. Here. Eric. Here. Eric Diaz. Yeah, I'm here. Sumaya. I got you, buddy. Samaya Shamia. Patricia Felix. Here. Alvin Furman. Here. Ryan Gleason. Here. Deanna Hilliker. Here. Lionel Huerta. Here. Francisco Jasso. Here. Luis Jimenez. Here. James Knight. Here. Christian Lanson. Not here. Leopoldo Larios. Okay. Oscar Lopez. Oscar Lopez. Cassandra Barajas. I'm here. Okay. Diego. Diego Pepin. I'm here. I'm here. Okay. Luis. Here. I got you. Diego. Luis. Here. David Shuba. Is David here? David Silva. Okay. Silas. Silas Thorpe. Bobby. Here. Bobby's here. Bobby. I knew that. Esteban. Here. Here. I see you. And Melanie. Melanie Zacharias. Melanie. All right. Sorry it took so much time. It wouldn't have. It wouldn't have taken so much time if it wasn't for the fact that I'm on the moon right now. But anyway, live long and prosper. I'll see you on Tuesday. You finally really made it. Do that discussion, guys. Thank you. Thank you. I'll do it. Yeah, exactly. Actually, you guys know I do live on Vulcan, so. The ears, then. I live on Vulcan Avenue in Encinitas. I live on Vulcan Avenue in Encinitas. You shouldn't have done that. Now we know you later. Have a good one. Also, Professor, I need to talk to you. Yeah, well, it's a pretty big street. Okay. Enjoy your weekend. Thank you. All right. Have a good one, guys. Professor. Oh, Diego. I just had a question about. In the beginning of class, I talked about. About the assignment, I already had it done, but it closed right at 12:45. I was gonna ask about that, too, because I was actually working on it as we speak, but then realized, oh, it's close. What do I do now? That's a. Forgot I'd talk to you about it. Here's what you do right now. Hold on a second, guys. Hey, hold on a second. Hold on, hold on. I'm gonna fix you guys up. Was that a copy? This is for Manifesto. Communist Manifesto, right? Yeah. Yeah, I've had it for years. Like I said, I'm not a communist. I think it's good to. To know the material, though, so that you know how to make your own judgments and everything. I got the wrong book, okay? So instead I got Mortal Engines. I. I saw the red and I just picked it out. I didn't really look at the book saying, oh, book. Oh, well, yeah, I. I have never read that book, so you could tell me anything about it and I wouldn't know. So, basically, let me do this. Do you have a. Do you have a pen? Something to write with? Diego? Yes, I do have several books over here. Okay, do this. Write down this number. 70094, dash 10. 70094, 10, Diego. Okay. And then, Seamus, your number is 70094, 11. Okay? And. And what you need to do is when you turn. You have actually until the end of the semester to turn that work in, but turn it in sooner rather than later. And then when you do turn it in, put the number that I just gave you on the top of your document, and that way I'll be able to give you full credit. All right? Okay. Got it, guys. Got that. All right, thanks, Professor. That's all I really needed. All right, have a good weekend. Diego. Long and prosper. Anything else? Yeah. Live long and prosper or Peace and long life. That's the right answer. Peace and long life, and may the force be with you. Okay, too. That too. So. Anything else? Seamus? Are you. Are you there? Are you broken? Hello? You just died. I can't hear you. You're muted. Oh, sorry, my computer just died. You're muted, Seamus. I think I'm unmuted now. Okay, yeah, my computer just died, but I got. Yeah, I got the number in for it. Okay. Are you all set in? I think. How do I turn it in that way, though? Will it just give me the option to submit still? Just turn it just. Yeah, you can. You can submit it anytime. Just make sure you put the number at the top so when I grade it. I'll see that you've talked to me, and the answer the that way, I'll give you full credit. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. All right. There's been a lot. We'll have a great weekend. I'll see you on Tuesday. Okay. There's. There's been a little bit of a lag with your, like, audio and video. I'm not sure what it is, but it tends to. It's a pretty big delay, I'd say. Yeah, I just noticed that today. I'm gonna have to figure out how to fix that. Although it's technical, and I'm not. I'm a historian, but I'll do my best. Okay. I'll see you Tuesday. All right, well, have a good weekend. You too. I'll see you Tuesday. Bye.

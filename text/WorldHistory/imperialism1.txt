Okay, let's dive in. What really holds people together? I mean, when you think about it, what forces truly bind us? Is it like, common ancestry, a shared history, culture? Or is it just, you know, living in the same place? That's the fundamental question, isn't it? And these aren't just abstract ideas. They became incredibly powerful, sometimes really destructive forces, especially in the 19th and early 20th centuries. They literally reshaped the world map. Exactly. So today we're taking a deep dive into that specific period. Right. Roughly 1800 to 1900, often called the age of imperialism. Precisely. And this century, it threw down this massive challenge, a really stark one for nations everywhere basically modernize or be colonized. Wow. They had Europe, fueled by the Industrial revolution, projecting this immense power, military, technological, across the globe. So every other society suddenly found itself facing this wave. Really, they had to adapt, or they risk being swallowed up. And the response is the ideologies that popped up because of this pressure. They fundamentally changed everything. Societies, governments, even how individuals saw themselves. So our mission today is to unpack those big global ideologies. We're talking things like communism, social Darwinism, which sounds pretty intense. Oh, it is. And positivism. And then we want to zoom right in on Mexico, because Mexico seems like this incredibly vivid and, yeah, often tumultuous case study of a nation grappling with these exact same forces. It really is trying to figure out its identity, trying to modernize, trying to hold onto its sovereignty in a world suddenly dominated by European empires. And we've got some amazing source material to work with, looking at everything from, like, how the definition of a nation even developed to the really harsh realities of foreign exploitation on the ground. Yeah, the sources are fantastic. And you'll find some surprising things, like the whole concept of a nation, something we take for granted. Now. It's actually a pretty modern invention, historically speaking. It feels so old, doesn't it? But relatively new. And, yeah, there's that amazing kind of pointed anecdote you mentioned about a president who apparently went to pretty extreme lengths to appear whiter. That's why. Okay, we have to get to that. It really reflects the cultural pressures of the time. So, yeah, this deep dive should really uncover what defined this crucial century and hopefully what its legacy still means for us today. All right, let's start at the beginning, then. The building block. The nation. When we say nation today, what are we actually talking about? The sources define it as, okay, a large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular country or territory. Mm. The standard Definition, but thinking about it, just for us, what is a nation? It sounds simple, but as you said, the story behind how it became the dominant idea is. Well, it's complex. It really is. And the first crucial step is understanding the difference between two words we often use interchangeably. Nationalism and patriotism. Ah, okay. Yeah, people definitely mix those up all the time, but the difference is huge, especially for this period. So patriotism, think of it as pride in who you are. It's a personal thing, right? A special affection for your own country, identifying with its values, its heritage. Like wanting the best for it, Being willing to sacrifice. Exactly. The classic sentiment is I'll die for my country. But notice, that doesn't automatically mean saying your country's better than others. It's about loyalty, devotion to your own place, your own people. Okay, that makes sense. Loyalty. But then nationalism. Then there's nationalism. And this is where it gets, well, murkier and often much more dangerous. Our sources put it so bluntly, calling it pride in who you aren't. That's sharp, isn't it? It cuts right to the core. It's this intense identification of the individual with the nation state. And crucially, it often pushes aside older identities like your tribe, your region, even your religion to make the nation the number one thing you pledge allegiance to. So it demands supreme loyalty to the state. Yes. And while it definitely pushes for national self determination, you know, the idea that each nation should govern itself, which sounds good. The dangerous part is that nationalism almost always involves promoting your nation as inherently superior to all others. Right. That's the key distinction. Absolutely. That quote you mentioned earlier really nails it. I'll kill you to take your country because I'm better than you are. It's stark, but highlights the difference. Patriotism, sacrifice for your own nationalism, Often justification for dominating others. Wow. Okay, so how did this idea become so powerful? Where did it even come from? You said it was relatively new. To really get it, we need to rewind a bit. Go back to Europe before the Reformation, say around the 1400s. If you asked someone back then, who are you? Who? What's the first thing they'd say? Mm, not I'm French or I'm English. Probably not. The most immediate, most important answer for most people across Europe would have been, I am a Christian. The Catholic Church provided that big overarching identity, that sense of belonging that crossed local borders. So religion was the main unifier. Largely, yes. Think about those early Spanish explorers in the Americas. When they wrote home, they didn't constantly identify as Spanish. They called themselves Christians doing God's work, their primary legions, their shared identity was religious first. That is a massive difference from how we think now. So what changed? How did we get from I'm a Christian to I'm French? Well, it wasn't overnight, but gradually the Church's dominant position weakened. You had centuries of internal conflicts, devastating religious wars like the Thirty Years War, and of course, the massive upheaval of the Reformation itself. Right, splitting Christendom it. Exactly. So as that universal Christian identity started to fray, people naturally looked for something else to belong to something else to give them that sense of collective purpose. And that's when allegiance really started shifting towards the state. Ah, okay. So the state fills the vacuum left by the Church. In many ways, yes. You see this dramatic shift. Think of Louis the Fourth in France famously saying, l' etat, c' est moi. Yeah, I understand. That's personal. Absolute power embodied in the monarch. Right. But fast forward just over a century to the French Revolution. They completely flipped that idea. Suddenly the revolutionary cry was that everybody in France was French and together they were the state. Whoa. From the King being the state to the people being the state. Precisely. Identity wasn't handed down by a king or the church anymore. It came from being French, from speaking the same language, the vernacular, not Latin, living in the same territory, having this emerging sense of a shared destiny. It built this powerful new and very secular foundation for identity. And it wasn't just identity, was it? The state started taking over other roles too. Absolutely. This new nation state didn't just replace religion as the main identifier. It started copying its homework, so to speak. It absorbed and reshaped rituals, ceremonies, ways of showing collective allegiance. How? You mean like flags and anthems? Exactly. Think about it. Today you go to a big sporting event, say, here in the us what happens right before the game starts, the national anthem, everyone stands up, hand on heart. Right. Or think about patriotic parades, national holidays, fourth of July here, Bastille Day in France. These are in a very real sense, the modern secular replacements for the big religious processions, the feast days, the hymns that used to dominate public life. The rituals shifted from the church square to the town square, focused on the nation. That's fascinating. It's like the sacred got transferred to the secular state. In a way, yes. It co opted that deep human need for ritual and belonging. But you said earlier, this whole idea, the nation state was a European thing originally. That's the really crucial part. This specific model of a unifying sovereign nation state as we understand it now, it's fundamentally a European invention before European imperialism really took off. Other major civilizations, think India, China, Japan, the diverse societies across Africa and the Americas, they didn't organize themselves or think of themselves in quite this way. They had empires, kingdoms, complex societies, absolutely highly developed cultures, sophisticated political systems. But not nations in this specific European sense, defined by shared language, territory, and this idea of popular sovereignty tied to ethnicity or culture. So how did it spread everywhere if it was just a European idea? Well, that's the darker side of the story. It spread largely through European imperialism. As European powers colonized vast parts of the globe, they imposed this model. They drew borders, often arbitrarily created administrative units based on the nation state concept, and exported the ideology along with their armies and merchants. The fact that virtually everyone today lives within a nation state, that's a direct result, often a very violent result, of this European export. Wow. Okay. So if the nation state kind of replaced religion, what's its actual basis? If it's not divine, what is it? That's the million dollar question, isn't it? And the sources point to something really intriguing. The idea that it's based on a collective imagination. Collective imagination, what does that mean? Like it's just made up? Essentially, yes. It's an intellectual construct, a shared belief system rather than some concrete objective reality you can touch or measure. There's no gene for being German or Mexican. There's no physical thing that makes you part of a nation beyond a widespread collective agreement that you are. So it's powerful, but it's built on belief. A shared belief, a collective story people tell themselves and each other. And what's really interesting is how flexible this nation concept can be. It doesn't always stick neatly within geographical borders. How so? Think about movements like Pan Africanism, the idea of uniting people of African descent across the globe. Or the Jewish diaspora, maintaining a strong collective identity for centuries without a single homeland. Or the black diaspora forged through shared history and experience, regardless of location. Okay, yeah. Those identities cross borders. Or even on a much lighter note, think about something like the Red Sox nation for baseball fans. Aha. Okay, yeah, It's a perfect example. It's a completely made up relationship, Right. Not based on blood or land, but purely on shared passion, collective affiliation. It shows how powerful that imagined connection can be. So it's kind of a paradox then. It's made up, this collective imagination, but it became maybe the most powerful force driving history in the last couple of centuries. Exactly. That's the mind bending part. On one hand, this powerful nationalism fueled European imperialism because European nations felt they were Superior culturally, racially, technologically. They believed they had the right, even a duty, the white man's burden and all that, to dominate other peoples. That was nationalism justifying expansion. Right? We're better, so we should rule. But here's the ironic twist. The very idea of nationalism, once it was introduced to colonized peoples, also became the fuel for their resistance. As they saw Europeans asserting their national rights, they started asking, well, what about our national rights? Our right to self determination? Ah, so the colonizers own ideology got turned against them. Precisely. It became a powerful tool for anti colonial movements demanding freedom in the name of their own nationhood. And you can still feel that power today, can't you? You mentioned 9, 11 earlier. It's a stark example for someone living, say on the west coast. New York is physically far away. But the attack wasn't just felt in New York. It was felt as an attack on us, on the entire nation. That instant visceral sense of shared identity, shared outrage with people you've never met thousands of miles away. Yeah, that connection, it's largely a product of this collective imagination, this thing called nationalism. It's incredibly powerful, even now. Okay, so this sets the stage. Rising nationalism, Europe's industrial power booming. And that core challenge you mentioned, Modernize or be colonized. Exactly. That was the stark reality facing pretty much every non European nation in the 19th century. If you couldn't keep up with Europe's technological, economic and especially military advances, you were incredibly vulnerable. You risk becoming a colony, your resources taken, people ruled by outsiders. It wasn't just a possibility, it was happening all over the world. So how did nations respond? Were there common strategies? Broadly speaking, yeah. We can see three main paths emerging. First, you had nations that tried to modernize, but for various reasons struggled or failed to really pull it off effectively on their own terms. A lot of Spanish America, including Mexico, as we'll see, falls into this category. They saw the need, but got bogged down by internal conflicts or external pressures. Okay, tried but stumbled. What else? Second, you had nations like China, which initially tried to resist modernization, hoping to preserve their traditional ways, their cultural integrity. But this often left them wide open to being exploited or having unfavorable terms forced upon them by industrialized powers. So resistance didn't always work out well, often not in the face of overwhelming military power. And then the third path, which is maybe the most remarkable, nations like Japan. Japan not only embraced modernization incredibly rapidly and successfully, but they actually went a step further and became a major imperial power themselves. Wow, they turned the tables. They absolutely did. So these three responses, attempt and struggle, resist and suffer, or modernize and even imperialize. They really frame how different parts of the world navigated this incredible, challenging era. Let's dig into the ideologies that shaped these responses. The Industrial Revolution. It brought progress, sure, but also terrible conditions for many. Right. The working class, the proletariat. Exactly, the proletariat. People who own nothing but their ability to work often faced horrific living conditions. This was largely thanks to laissez faire capitalism, the idea that government should keep its hands off the economy. In reality, this often meant employers could set wages, hours, and conditions pretty much however they liked, leading to widespread exploitation. And communism came out of that as a reaction? Precisely. Communism was a direct radical response to those excesses. You have the Communist manifesto published in 1848 by Marx & Engels, which just laid into the whole system. What was their core argument? They believe the fundamental problem wasn't a lack of stuff being produced, but the incredibly unfair way property and wealth were distributed. The solution they proposed, Absolutely revolutionary. Get rid of private property altogether. Whoa. All private property. All private ownership of the means of production, factories, land, machines. Instead, everything would be owned in common by the community, and production would be organized for the benefit of everyone. The goal was a classless society. No more exploitation. I can imagine that didn't go down well with everyone. Not at all. Liberals, industrialists, anyone who owned property. They saw communism as an existential threat. It wasn't just an economic theory. It was an attack on the very foundations of their society. On private property rights, on the liberal nation state itself. It was seen as incredibly dangerous, aiming to tear down the whole existing order. Okay, so that's one major ideological response. What else was brewing in the 19th century? You mentioned Darwin earlier. Ah, yes, Charles Darwin. Now, it's crucial to remember Darwin was a scientist, a biologist. He wasn't trying to create a political ideology. His work, based on meticulous observation. The fossil record, his voyage on the Beagle led him to the idea of evolution by natural selection. Species changing over time, adapting. Exactly. A massive challenge to the prevailing view that all species were created, fixed and unchanging. His idea was natural selection. Environmental changes favor certain traits, allowing those individuals to survive and reproduce better while others die out. Importantly, he saw it as largely random, not guided by some conscious selector, just nature doing its thing. Right. But then others took Darwin's purely biological ideas and did something really problematic with them. They twisted them and applied them directly to human societies and politics. This became known as Social Darwinism. Social Darwinism. Okay. How did that work or not work? Well, the core argument was pretty brutal. He said, okay, the environmental change in human society is this massive shift from farming to industry. Therefore, those individuals or companies or even whole nations that succeed in this new competitive industrial world, they are the fittest. Uh oh, I can see where this is going. Yeah. The chilling implication was that the weaker members of society, the poor, the unsuccessful, those struggling in the slums, they were destined to die out. And maybe some argued they should be allowed to die out, to leave behind a stronger, supposedly more evolved population. Incredibly bleak. Just let people suffer and die. That was the grim logic. If people were poor, living in terrible conditions, Social Darwinists might argue against aid or reform, saying it interferes with the natural process of weeding out the unfit. They applied the same logic to nations. If a country couldn't modernize, couldn't compete, let it fail, let it be colonized. Only the fittest nations deserve to survive. Wow. Okay, thinking about that, what stands out to you as the biggest, most obvious, flawless. Well, beyond the staggering immorality of it, the most glaring practical flaw, as the sources point out, is the simple fact that the weaker ears are not going to let themselves just die. Right? People fight back. They don't just passively accept starvation or misery. Exactly. It completely ignores human agency, resilience and the inevitability of social unrest if you push people too far. But it's fascinating, isn't it? Both the Social Darwinists and the Marxists looked at industrialization and saw massive change coming. Yeah, they agreed on the cause, but not the outcome. Totally different predictions. Social Darwinists thought the proletariat would just fade away, die out. Marxists predicted they'd rise up in revolution and overthrow the whole system. So why didn't Social Darwinism become like official government policy everywhere? It sounds like it justified a lot of what was happening. Thankfully, it was mostly rejected as official national policy for a couple of key reasons. One was the sheer pragmatism. Letting large chunks of your population suffer and die inevitably leads to chaos, instability, maybe revolution. No stable government wants that. Bad for business, bad for control. You got it. And the second reason was morality. Most societies, despite the harshness of the era, still found the idea of consciously letting masses die deeply unethical, fundamentally wrong. Though you did mention some exceptions where mass deaths were allowed. Tragically, yes. We saw it later, horrifically under certain communist regimes. Stalin's Russia, Mao's China, where millions perish through famine or purges. Sometimes justified in the name of building a supposedly better future. It's also important, though, to distinguish this from Nazi ideology. How so? While both led to unimaginable horrors, Nazism was driven primarily by a racist replacement theory, the idea that one inferior race had to be eliminated for a superior one. Social Darwinism, at least in its original formulation, was more about survival of the fittest within a society's economic or social structure, affecting its own population, rather than a specifically genocidal racial project targeting others. Though clearly the lines could and did blur horribly in practice. Okay, so communism, social Darwinism. What was the third big ideology? Positivism. That sounds less. That's. It sounds more neutral. Definitely. Positivism actually has roots way back in the scientific revolution. The core belief is that science, through observation and reason, offers this unending path to discovering objective truth. Truth that's universal, not affected by culture or politics, like 2, 2, 4. It's true everywhere for everyone. Exactly. That's the ideal. Positivists believe you could apply this scientific method to discover similar universal truths about everything, including human society. So applying science to society. Precisely. Andre Auguste Comte, a French philosopher, often called the founder of sociology. He really pushed the idea of applying scientific principles to study society systematically. If we can understand the laws of physics, why not the laws of society? That was the thinking. He established the whole concept of social science. Okay, so social science is born. How does that lead to a theory of government? Well, it led to social positivism. The big idea here was really ambitious. If you can study social activities scientifically, like in a controlled lab experiment, then maybe you can manage society itself scientifically, guiding it towards modernization and progress in a rational, orderly way. Manage society like a science experiment? That's the gist. And if society is going to be scientifically managed, who should do the managing? Scientists. Right, but not necessarily guys in white coats mixing chemicals. More like technocrats. Experts. People with specialized knowledge and practical fields. Education, building, infrastructure organizing, laboratory boosting, manufacturing. These were the people armed with data and scientific principles who were supposed to make the rational decisions to guide society forward. Technocrats running the show. Exactly. Now connect this back to that big challenge. Modernize or be colonized. Remember how brutal early industrialization was in places like England? Took forever. Caused immense suffering. Yeah. Decades, Generations of hardship. Social positivism offered what looked like a shortcut, A way to get modern, get industrialized without all that pain and chaos. How? By having these expert technocrats intentionally, rationally, scientifically manage the whole process. It was basically a massive blueprint for social engineering, aiming for efficient, orderly progress. And this idea became incredibly influential, especially in Latin America, where countries were desperate to catch up with Europe. Which brings us, Neely, to Mexico. You said it's a prime example of grappling with these forces. What was happening there after independence? Chaos, mostly. After Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821. The next 50 years were just incredibly unstable. They lacked stable political institutions. Elections happened, but routinely the loser would cry fraud, grab their guns, and try to take power by force. So elections just led to more fighting. Pretty much, yeah. Instead of peaceful transitions, you got military conflicts. Imagine trying to build a country when every election risks sparking another civil war. It was constant turmoil. What were they fighting about besides just who got to be in charge? Underlying it all was this fundamental disagreement about how the country should even be run. You had the centralists on one side. They wanted a strong central government, maybe even a monarchy. Again, kind of looking back to the structure of colonial New Spain. Power concentrated in Mexico City. Okay, power at the top. And opposing them were the Federalists. They looked north to the United States and saw success in distributing power among states. They believed a federal system with more local control was the path to prosperity and stability. And they couldn't compromise, not effectively. This divide was deep, bitter, and often insurmountable. Through politics, it spilled over into violence. The grim joke, according to the sources, was that the only way the Federalists could win was to kill all the centralists and vice versa. Just brutal, ongoing conflict. And this evolved into liberals versus conservatives. Yeah, the labels shifted and overlapped, but the core conflicts remained. Conservatives generally lined up with the centralists. They favored tradition, often monarchy, and strongly supported the power of the church and the military institutions that had been dominant in the colonial era. Right. The old guard and the liberals tended to be Federalists. They pushed for local control, democratic reforms, and crucially, reducing the power of the church to create a more secular state. But again, this wasn't just debates in Congress. It led to actual civil wars over the direction of the country. Figures like Santa Ana being president multiple times on different platforms really embodied this constant instability. And all this internal fighting must have made Mexico vulnerable to outsiders. Hugely vulnerable. And outsiders took advantage. Spain tried to muscle back in during the 1830s. Then the big one, the US intervention, the 1840s, the Mexican American War, which was catastrophic for Mexico. They lost almost half their territory. California, Texas, the Southwest, all of it. And then, incredibly, another major foreign intervention in the 1860s. This time France, Britain, and Spain initially coming to collect debts. Just one thing after another. But amidst this, you said liberal ideas were gaining ground. The Constitution of 1857 yes. Somehow, amidst all the chaos, liberal reformers managed to push through the Constitution of 1857. This was a really big deal. Part of a larger movement called La Reformation. It aimed to break the power of the old colonial structures. How? What did it do? Key things were land reform, trying to break up large estates and communal indigenous lands to create individual private property, and crucially, going after the Church. The Church owned vast amounts of land and wealth. Liberals saw it as blocking progress, hindering a modern capitalist economy. So the Constitution forced the Church to sell off much of its land and tried to separate Church and state. I bet the conservatives in the Church loved that. Oh, absolutely. Furious. These reforms directly attacked their power bases. So naturally, it just led to more conflict, more war. The War of the Reform followed immediately. Okay, this is where it gets really wild, right? The French intervention. This is truly one of history's stranger episodes. So Britain and Spain eventually pulled out of that joint intervention in the 1860s, but France, under Napoleon III decided to stay. He had this grand vision of creating a French influenced Catholic empire in Mexico to counter US power. So France decided to just install a monarch? Pretty much. They invited Maximilian von Habsburg, an Austrian archduke no less, to become Emperor of Mexico. And they backed him with the French army. Unbelievable. How did the Mexicans react? Well, Mexican conservatives largely supported Maximilian, seeing him as a way to restore order and defeat the liberals. But the liberals, led by Benito Juarez, refused to give in. Juarez had to flee Mexico City, literally carrying the government archives in a cartoon, waging a guerrilla war against the French and their conservative allies for five or six years. Oh, wait, what about the us? The Monroe Doctrine. Didn't that say Europe should stay out of the Americas? Excellent question. Normally the US would have strongly objected, but what else was happening in the US in the early 1860s? Ah, the Civil War. Exactly. The US was completely preoccupied with its own internal conflicts, so it couldn't really intervene against France. But as soon as the Civil war ended in 1865, they turned their attention seriously. Immediately, the US sent a large army under General Sheridan to the border and applied intense diplomatic pressure on France to withdraw its troops. Napoleon iii, facing pressure and the high cost of the war, finally pulled the plug on supporting Maximilian. And what happened to Maximilian? Without French military backing, his regime quickly collapsed. Juarez's liberal forces captured him, and despite some international pleas for clemency, they executed him by firing squad in 1867. Wow. And the irony you mentioned, the deep irony is that Maximilian himself was actually quite liberal. He tried to enact reforms, uphold some of Juarez's earlier laws, but it didn't matter to Mexican nationalists. He was a foreign invader imposed by a European power. His liberalism couldn't save him from being seen as illegitimate. His execution was a powerful statement of Mexican sovereignty. So Juarez returns to power. Does Mexico finally find stability? Does. There's still some turmoil after Juarez dies in 1872, but eventually Mexico enters a very different phase under one of its military heroes, Porfirio Diaz. Diaz. He was a hero of Cinco de Mayo, right? The Battle of Pueblo. That's the one celebrated liberal general. But after Juarez's death and a period of political maneuvering, Diaz effectively takes control in 1876 and manages to stay in power for, well, an incredibly long time. Until 1911. This whole era, over three decades, is known as the Porfiriato. 35 years. How did he manage that? Wasn't there a constitution limiting terms? There was. The 1857 Constitution, which Diaz himself had fought for, initially limited the presidency to a single four year term. But Diaz found ways around it. Essentially, every four years he'd have his compliant Congress pass a quick amendment allowing reelection, and then he'd run unopposed. It was democracy on paper, dictatorship in practice. Why did people accept it? What was his justification? His rationale, and that of the elite group running the country with him, known as the Scientificos, was pure social positivism. They argued Mexico simply wasn't ready for real democracy yet. It was too unstable, too backward. First, it needed strong expert leadership to scientifically manage it into modernity. The technocrats again. Exactly. The Scientificos were the embodiment of that idea. They were intellectuals, experts in finance, infrastructure, education, industry. Their job was to apply scientific principles to modernize Mexico efficiently. What was their slogan? You mentioned slogans earlier. Their initial slogan captured the liberal ideal. Liberty, order and progress. Liberty for foreign interference, liberty from internal chaos, and progress toward modernization. But as Diaz consolidated power, the liberty part kind of faded. Yeah, they realized that messy democratic liberty sometimes got in the way of efficient, orderly progress. So the official slogan became simply order and progress. Maintain order by force if necessary, so that you can achieve progress. Democracy could wait until later, when Mexico was prepared. Order and progress. How did he maintain that order? With a combination of shrewd politics and brute force. He created the Rurales, a kind of federal mounted police force. Very effective, often ruthless at suppressing banditry and dissent in the countryside. And his overall strategy was famously called Peno Paulo. Bread or the stick. Bread or the stick. Simple. Cooperate with the regime, stay in line and you'll get benefits, bread, opportunities. Maybe a government job. But if you resist, if you cause trouble, you get the stick. Punishment, imprisonment, maybe worse. It was a very effective, if harsh, way of keeping control. And it did admittedly bring a level of stability Mexico hadn't seen in generations. The constant civil wars stopped. So the Porfiriado achieved some things. Then it wasn't all bad. That's the paradox. On the surface, there are undeniable successes. Civil order was largely restored. The political chaos subsided, the economy stabilized, the currency was reliable, and Diaz aggressively courted foreign investment. So factories, railroads. Absolutely huge expansion of railroads connecting the country. Mines were developed, factories were built, oil production started. If you just looked at the economic statistics, Mexico seemed to be modernizing rapidly, finally catching up. But there's always a but. The massive but is who benefited. And what's really fascinating and ultimately tragic here is that almost all the profits from this modernization flowed out of Mexico. The railroads, the mines, the oil fields, the factories, they were overwhelmingly owned by foreign investors. Americans, British, French. So Mexicans weren't seeing the benefits of their own country's resources. Very few did. The wealth was concentrated in the hands of foreigners and a tiny Mexican elite collaborating with them. For the vast majority of Mexicans, peasant farmers losing their land, workers in the new factories and mines facing harsh conditions and low pay, life didn't improve. In many cases, it got worse. People were starving in the countryside while Mexico was exporting food crops for profit. Wow. So modernization created wealth, but not for most Mexicans. Exactly. It created massive inequality and deep resentment. The suffering caused by this lopsided progress wasn't being addressed. And that simmering discontent, that sense of injustice, eventually boiled over. This period of seeming order and progress directly paved the way for the incredibly violent decade long Mexican revolution that erupted in 1910. That really puts things in perspective. Which leads us to the canea strike in 1906. You said this was like a microcosm of the whole era. It really is. It perfectly encapsulates the foreign economic control, the exploitation, and the simmering resistance. So picture this. Kenya, a huge copper mine just 40 miles south of the Arizona border in Sonora, owned entirely by an American, Colonel, William Green. A direct result of Diaz inviting foreign capital, Textbook example. And Kenya itself didn't even look much like a Mexican town anymore. It was a classic American style company town. Colonel Greene built himself this big imposing mansion that literally overshadowed the local Catholic church. A powerful visual symbol of who was really in charge of foreign capital literally dominating the landscape. Right. And the injustice wasn't subtle. The company used a blatant dual wage System, American workers, often supervisors or skilled laborer, got paid $3 a day. Mexican workers doing the same dangerous back breaking labor underground, they got paid 3 pesos. Okay, $3 versus 3 pesos. What was the exchange rate? About 2 pesos to $1 back then. So effectively, Mexican workers were earning half what American workers earned for the exact same job, half the pay for the same work. Plus Mexicans faced segregated housing, worse conditions, and basically zero chance of promotion into skilled or supervisory roles. It was blatant discrimination built right into the system. Thinking about that specific setup, what really strikes you as the core injustice there? It's just the sheer unfairness of it. Doing the same hard, dangerous work, but getting paid half as much simply because of your nationality and living in your own country, but being treated as a second class citizen by a foreign company. It's infuriating just hearing about it. Absolutely. And you can imagine how Mexican intellectuals and activists felt. Cannonia became this potent symbol of everything wrong with the perfirado. Foreign domination, exploitation. The government seemingly siding with foreign interests over its own people. People like Esteban Calderon, a local baker and liberal activist, and Abran Salcido, a labor organizer, started working with the miners, channeling that anger, organizing resistance. Exactly. And on June 2, 1906, they felt ready. Thousands of miners went on strike, gathered together and prepared to present their demands. Equal pay for equal work, better conditions, the right to promotion. How did the company respond? Colonel Greene? Greene came out to talk to them, but it wasn't a negotiation. He basically tried to smooth talk them, Told them the Mexican president wouldn't allow raises, likely untrue. And then appealed to them as a friend to just go back to work. As a friend. Yeah, right. The miners weren't buying it. They refused. Their numbers swelled as they marched through the camp to gather more support. Maybe 2500 strong by now. Many dressed in their Sunday best to show unity and seriousness. And then things turned violent. Tragically, yes. They marched towards a lumber yard owned by two American brothers, the Metcalfes. Known for being hostile, George Metcalfe had been warned they were coming. As the large peaceful crowd approached, the brothers reacted violently. First they sprayed the miners with high pressure water hoses, just attacked them unprovoked. When the hoses didn't disperse the crowd, the Metcalfes opened fire with rifles, shooting directly into the miners, killing two or three instantly. Oh my God. The reaction was explosive. The miners, enraged by the cold blooded murder, attacked the lumberyard office, setting it on fire when the Metcalf brothers ran out. Still Shooting the miners overwhelmed them and killed them both. One reportedly beaten to death with the miners own heavy candlesticks they used underground. Desperate, furious violence. Meeting brutal violence. Exactly. The conflict spread. Armed Americans, led by Greene, confronted the armed miners. Then later that afternoon, Mexican government troops arrived. And controversially, they were soon joined by about 270 armed Arizona Rangers. Arizona Rangers crossing the border into Mexico illegally? Yes, it was a clear violation of Mexican sovereignty. To cover it up, the local governor quickly deputized them after the fact. But their presence armed Americans intervening on Mexican soil to put down Mexican workers was deeply inflammatory. So the strike was crushed brutally. The combined force of Mexican troops and American Rangers put down the strike leaders like Salcedo were arrested and jailed. In total, about 23 people died, 17 of them Mexican minors, and none of their demands were met. On the surface, it was a total failure, but its impact was huge, immense. The Canera strike, despite being defeated, became legendary. It was seen as this heroic, tragic stand against foreign tyranny and government complicity. The image of American Rangers crossing the border to shoot Mexican workers, it galvanized national feeling like never before. Many historians point to Kenya as a key catalyst, maybe the key catalyst that ignited the Mexican Revolution just four years later. It showed that the order and progress of the Porfiriados served foreigners, not Mexicans, and that the only path left was revolution. It really hammers home that imperialism wasn't abstract. It was about real bodies, real suffering, real injustice that eventually exploded. That's incredibly powerful. And it connects to that other point you made earlier, about identity, about European influence going beyond just economics and politics. Right. There was this deeper cultural impact, this ongoing debate within Spanish America. Who are we? Are we primarily an indigenous nation drawing strength from our pre Columbian roots? Or should we strive to become European, adopting European culture, values, even appearances, as the path to modernity and respect? A real identity crisis, a profound one. And many leaders, particularly in Mexico during this period, leaned heavily towards emulating Europe, especially France, which was seen as the pinnacle of civilization and sophistication. They tried quite deliberately to make their nations look and feel more European. And this even affected someone like Porfirio Diaz. You mentioned an anecdote. Yes, it's quite striking. Diaz himself, the strongman ruler of Mexico for decades, the symbol of Mexican power, he was a full blooded Zapotec Indian from Oaxaca, indigenous roots. Really? I wouldn't have guessed from pictures. Exactly. And that was partly by design. Sources suggest he was quite conscious of his appearance and desired to look whiter, more European. There's this persistent anecdote maybe apocryphal, but telling that he used to put milk or some kind of rice powder on his face every to lighten his skin. Wow. Milk on his face. Whether literally true or not, it speaks volumes about the internalized pressure. His later photographs. With the groomed mustache, the formal European style military uniforms. He looks more like a stern German general, or as you said, even a bit like Stalin, than a man of indigenous Mexican heritage. That's incredible. The president of Mexico trying to physically erase his own heritage to fit a European ideal. It's a poignant symbol of how deep that cultural pressure went. Even national heroes felt this need to conform to the colonizers aesthetic standards. And remember, Benito Juarez before him was also a full blooded indigenous man. It highlights his complex internal struggle within Mexico's identity. And you said this wasn't unique to Mexico, this push to emulate Europe? No, you see similar things elsewhere. Think of Japan during the Meiji Restoration. As part of their incredibly rapid modernization, they enthusiastically adopted Western clothing, hairstyles, military structures, political ideas. It was seen as part of becoming modern and strong enough to resist Western domination. It just underscores how pervasive that European model became, shaping not just economies, but culture and even self perception on a really deep level. What an absolutely incredible sweep of history and ideas. We've gone from the very birth of nationalism and that crucial difference with patriotism. Right? Pride in who you aren't versus pride in who you are. Through these huge competing ideologies trying to make sense of the industrial world. Communism's radical equality, Social Darwinism's brutal survival of the fittest, and positivism's dream of scientific management. Each offering a drastically different path forward or justification for the present. And then seeing it all play out so vividly, so intensely in Mexico. The Porfiriado's order and progress, that promise of modernization, but at such a terrible human cost. Yeah, the Kenneas strike really brings that home. How these big abstract ideas, imperialism, foreign investment, national resources, translated into real tangible exploitation and suffering, which in turn fueled revolution. It shows these weren't just philosophical debates, they had life and death consequences. Absolutely. So as we finish up this deep dive, maybe the final thought for you, the listener, is to consider how these forces unleashed back in the 19th century nationalism, the drive to modernize, the tension between local identity and global pressures, how they're still shaping our world right now. That's a great point. How do our modern ideas about what a nation is or what progress looks like still carry the echoes, the DNA of these foundational concepts and all their built in conflicts and tensions. It makes you think about borders, identity politics, economic development debates. Today, it all seems connected back to this pivotal era. It really does. So we definitely encourage you to keep exploring these themes. The more we understand these historical currents, the better equipped we are to understand the challenges and opportunities we face today.
